### Day 62: February 5th, Sunder	

**Today's Progress**: Completely stuck

**Thoughts** Stressed and dejected. Private life is completely overshadowing coding at the moment. I need to get things done before I can get back on track.

### Day 63: February 6th, Monday	

**Today's Progress**: Still nothing done.

**Thoughts** Stress at max levels. Finished 'gathering' documentation. I'm submitting tomorrow.

### Day 64: February 7th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**: I decided to 'lift' a solution from stackoverflow and analyse it. 

**Thoughts** I will not get bogged down and waste time trying to reinvent the wheel. I will analyse other people's code and learn from it. I've submitted application, levels of stress plumeted down. I can resume work!

### Day 65: February 8th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**: 'Almost' figured out how to prime factorize numbers

**Thoughts** It would seem that fun and games are over. Algorithms revolve around maths, and I am crumbling underneath the complexity of these easy mathematical problems. I say easy, but I find them hard, even though I know objectivly that they are simple math problems. I just don't have practice in solving these kinds of problems in programming. It whole different game, than solving math problems on paper. I feel I will be stuck for a while. And these aren't even advanced algos...fun times!

### Day 66: February 9th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**:  I fix the factoring loop! 

**Thoughts** It's crazy, I couldn't figure out what was wrong yesterday to save my freaking life. Today I instantly noticed that one line was messed up, quick fix and bam shazam, it works like a charm. Also made it faster with few tweaks! Amazing! Man, when things work, you feel like you are on top of the world, but when they don't ... oh Lord, you are in the pits, and there is no light in the proverbial tunnel. 
Anyway, enough for today. Quick session.

### Day 67: February 10th, Friday	

**Today's Progress**:  No progress. Stuck on object comparison.

**Thoughts** Every time I FEEL I don't know how to do something, I get stuck. I stop trying to solve the problem and simply retreat. Apathy, dejection and learned helplesness. I need to learn how to break down things. How to make them simplier, otherwise I will have a hard time getting anything done long term...life...term.

### Day 68: February 11th, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**:  Did bit of research into objects. No progress

**Thoughts** Today was a relaxing day. I've done a bit of reading, bit of youtube, took a stab at the object comparison. Nothing realy achieved or learned, but still good day. I'm positive. I had fun playing board game, overall pleasent day. Trying to stay in the moment I guess. I notice a frustration simmering underneath my skin. I explode easily and I've got dickhead responsens a lot of times. No idea why. Is it because of procrastination? Could be. I'd like to work on coding habit again. Start at specific time, establish cue to enhance habit. Keep reinforcing it.

### Day 69: March 12th, Sunday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished prime factoring loop for multiple numbers [nested loop]

**Thoughts** Yes! I did it, finally figured out what to do. I had to read the problem again, realised it is far more complex than I thought, wated to give up. Seriously! But then I realised that I just need to break it down, and I can do this! Efficacy. Anyway, I had a thought, maybe all I have to do is find prime factors for all numbers, and somehow it will all add up magically. I took an old fashioned piece of paper and pen, and did what my math teacher from DIT taught me. Test it, step by step, see where it leads you. Well, turns out it led me to an answer. Yes, it did add up! So all I had to do was to nest my original loop inside another one that would go through all the numbers. Took me ages, because I missed one variable, but hey...it wouldn't be a coding evening if I didn't miss a proverbial semicolon. Anyway, I'm nearly there. Now I have to figure out how to filter the prime numbers, and we are done!

### Day 70: March 13th, Monday	

**Today's Progress**:  No progress.

**Thoughts** Too tired and dejected to write today (written the following day). I am loosing this battle, battle against myself...against bad habits. I'll be damn if I will stop fighting though! One, two, even hundred lost battles will not stop me from winning this war.

### Day 71: March 14th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Re learned how to remove duplicates from an array.

**Thoughts** It's highly demoralising when you realise that you don't remember how to do basic staff that you did a month ago. But there is only one person to judge me on that, and that's myself. What good will it do to me to get down, and bemoan the fact that most of the stuff I learned didn't 'stick' ? Of course it didn't stick! I've done moste of this stuff only once, and never revisited it again. There's no way I could remember. Insted I should be overjoyed at the fact that I vaguely remember doing something like that. Also, keeping notes, like I've done, payed off handsomly, because all I needed to do today, was to look up my prevoius algorithms and vouila! Duplicate removal code at my feet, ready to rock and roll! So let's get real here, and stop putting ourselves down. Coding is all about grit, not math, not iq, just plain old persistance and daily work! We are not on schedule, we are not in a rush! I'm not racing anybody but my own ego. I gotta keep reminding myself why I'm coding in the first place, and that is to fullfill my hearts desire to learn indefinitely and to create something out of 'nothing'! To have skills that can alter my, and my fellow people, lifes in a positive way! So stay calm, and keep coding. 4321§§

### Day 72: March 15th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished 'Find Smallest Common Multiple' algorithm

**Thoughts** It happened! Holly cow, I still can't believe it! I did it, this was, by far, the most complex, and challanging algo so far. Over 100 lines! And I did use shortcuts, like, I didn't bother implementing previous algo (used to find prime numbers), but simply used array of primes. Wow...simply wow! Even bigger wow came to me at work today, when I tried algos after that one (turns out you don't have to do them in order). I solved one with ONE LINE, another one with THREE LINES. It's like...not quite...even difficulty level. But hey, fuck it. I'm going forward, and that's what matters. Also, I am capable of nesting three loops one inside another one, and actually not loose track of what the hell is going on. Damn, I'm actually quite impressed with myself. Ha! Side note: I played tennis before coding. There's a good chance that physicall activity before coding infused me with more focus and allowed me to finish this algo today.

### Day 73: March 16th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**:  Day off.

**Thoughts** I played board games, had two beers. Afterwards, I felt so tired that I decided to just go to bed. It's fine.

### Day 74: March 17th, Friday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished 'flattening algorithm', learned binary code

**Thoughts** I didn't do much today, did some youtube on js, lifted and analyzed an algorithm from mdn site, started on binary algorithm. It looks very interesting. I like when they make you learn stuff. I always imagined that binary would be this complicated thing, but it turns out to be very straightforward. Anyway, writing algorithm that translates binary to acii will be anything but straightforward. Challange accepted (I probably will lift solution from stackoverflow, but hey, I'll give it a good try before I do!)

### Day 75: March 18th, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished two more algorithms.

**Thoughts** I started coding early in the morning, while still in bed. I've watched few movies, had a dinner, went out to see Marcin.
Around lunch, I've decided to check on my girlfirend. We havent spoken in nearly two weeks, she needed to 'think things through'. She was very unhappy...I guess, she wouldn't share or talk to me about it. In all fairness I didn't share my true feeling either.
Anyway, I knew what was coming. She broke up with me. I didn't ask why. This was the second time she broke up with me. First time around I talked with her, she presented her 'issues', I offered solution, and we reached compromise. This time around I decided not to fight. She was unhappy, and there was nothing I could do about it. I was the cause, the only solution (in my eyes) was to let her go, let her find someone who could give her what I couldn't. I don't feel much. Not because I haven't had feeling for her, but simply because that's what I've became over the years. I was really going to abandon my home, my whole life that I've built over past 10 years, and travel across the  world to live with her. My idea was to live together with her for about a year, and if things worked out, to get married. Just like that. Terrifying perpective for me, but I looked forward to opening new chapeter in my life, and new challenges. I was confident I could make it work. 
But it's all over, and I don't know if I made a good decision. I will have to learn to live with this.

### Day 76: March 19th, Sunday	

**Today's Progress**:  No progress, stuck on test's for 'non number'

**Thoughts** Annoyed, it was suppoused to be easy test. It has proven infuriating. I decided to let it go. I have a feeling I will solve it tomorrow...all I have to do is to walk away, and it will come to me. Always does.

### Day 77: March 20th, Monday	

**Today's Progress**:  Solved the last intermediate algorithm!

**Thoughts** As expected, I found the issue. Turnes out test was good, all checked out. I simply forgot to return results of the function that was testing the values. Wow. Talking about waste of time. Now...did I learned something from this? Fucking hope so! :)

### Day 78: March 21st, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Started on first advanced algo

**Thoughts** Not much to say.

### Day 79: March 22nd, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Already stuck on first algo

**Thoughts** RegExp is nasty. I thought I can just brake it down, and eliminate all cases with few simple tests, but nope. shit got real. I keep seeing myself in some asian country, freelancing, hidden away in a countryside, chillin. Is this the dream now? Would it really be freedon? The only freedom we can aspire to achieve is the one from our own, self-imposed, limitations. Discipline gives a true freedom, not coding skills.

### Day 80: March 23rd, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished first and second advanced algorithm!

**Thoughts** I overslept today to work. I found myself without spark at work. Something bothers me, and I don't know what. Is it the thought that I'll be leaving in the next half a year (or so) ? Or maybe because I don't know where and what will I do afterwards?
There are so many options in my life, so many choices, and more importantly, so much uncertainty! But I need it ( the uncertainty, that is).

### Day 81: March 24rd, Friday	

**Today's Progress**:  Started on third algorithm.

**Thoughts** I coded only at work today. Got solid two hours of work (at work...). Took it easy today (although I'm starting to wander if taking 'days off' does make things easier for me (in the long term - also notice this is a nested side note - lol))


**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

### Day 82: March 25rd, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**:  Realised third algo is much harder than previous one's (maybe)

**Thoughts** I've been reading new book 'The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck'. It's amazing, just like the 'War of Art'. It took me by surprise and provided new insights. More importantly it showed me that I can still learn from self - help books (I know right? I'm very humble and not full of shit at all). Anyway, I'm really happy I happened to chance on it( was it a chance? free code camp or something affiliated recomended it ...maybe?). Doesn't matter how I found it, important is that I did. And I'm learning. Again. Yes! Biggest insight so far? I guess the fact that we are always wrong. When we were children, we had our fantastic explanations to many things, when we were teenagers we were completely delusional about our image and many other things...etc...the point is, its naive to believe that at any given point 'we figured things out' and found the truth. It's impossible to find the 'truth', all we can aspire to is be less wrong, which in long term approximate towards truth without ever reaching it (we die beforehand). This makes me want to revisit a lot of my current assumptions. Very stimulating book, happy days (what's with all those cliche one liners?). Anyway, the book is a true joy to read. Maybe this time I will say thank you to the author?

### Day 83: March 26rd, Sunday	

**Today's Progress**:  Re written third algo. Taking new approach. 

**Thoughts** I finished the 'Subtle Art of ...'. Great book, there is a chapter where the author describes how he got to the edge of the cliff. Step by step. While I was reading it, I could see it with my own eyes (well you know what I mean). By the end of it, I was sweating bullets! Trully powerful experience. I don't think I've experience anything like that before, while reading a freaking book. Great stuff. Will this book change anything? Probably not, but it's another small step towards someting better.
I was wandering today what should I do with my life in the coming months. I feel like I have to move. Asia, Italy...anywhere, just gotta get out. The very thought of going to a foreign country, without knowing the language, without any chance of getting job and steady income. Being completely alone amids crouds of people. Very freightening...and that's the only reason I want to do it. At the same time, wouldn't it make more sense to stay? Finish college degree, get a job and experience under my belt, and then move? Move only when I can truly work remotely and support myself? Wouldn't it be counterproductive to jump the gun on this one? At the same time I just 'feel' I gotta go, experience loneliness, blank slate, face my own demons and either emerge a new man or succomb to them for the last time. There are too many options ...

### Day 84: March 27th, Monday	

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on VBA macro 

**Thoughts** Sooo..vba. It's like any other language, except that it's not! what the hell is wrong with Microsoft? Can't they even get this one thing right? Ok, ok. It's not that bad, I just don't get the synthax. I guess, I made good progress given that I've never done anything in this language before...but that again...4 hours just to delete few columns? Damn. Anyway, I'm acting like a little bitch lately, and I can't help myself. I want to lash out at others. I'm actually quite unhappy because of my broken relationship. I haven't felt anything for this girl, or so I thought, and now I'm ...well upset. I keep coming back to times we spent together, places we've seen, things we did, food that she cooked. I know I'm exagerating now, and my mind is spinning only positive things now. I just can't help it. But that's life, at the risk of sounding cliche, just gotta embrace it. The joy and pain.

### Day 85: March 28th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished third advanced algo, continued working on vba macro, watched utube tuts on vba 

**Thoughts** Ahhh, so happy I managed to finish that algo! I really wrapped it up nicely using reduce() function. Awesome :_ . I'm looking forward to learning more vba and being able to manipulate the data. It's relevant because it touches on the work that my whole team is doing. thank again, I don't want to go too far, and stretch myself too thin. My priority remains FCC, this is just a small side project. It's crazy how my mood swings once I get some dumb ass algo done. It's worrysome...i guess.
