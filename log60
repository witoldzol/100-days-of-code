### Day 62: February 5th, Sunder	

**Today's Progress**: Completely stuck

**Thoughts** Stressed and dejected. Private life is completely overshadowing coding at the moment. I need to get things done before I can get back on track.

### Day 64: February 7th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**: I decided to 'lift' a solution from stackoverflow and analyse it. 

**Thoughts** I will not get bogged down and waste time trying to reinvent the wheel. I will analyse other people's code and learn from it. I've submitted application, levels of stress plumeted down. I can resume work!

### Day 65: February 8th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**: 'Almost' figured out how to prime factorize numbers

**Thoughts** It would seem that fun and games are over. Algorithms revolve around maths, and I am crumbling underneath the complexity of these easy mathematical problems. I say easy, but I find them hard, even though I know objectivly that they are simple math problems. I just don't have practice in solving these kinds of problems in programming. It whole different game, than solving math problems on paper. I feel I will be stuck for a while. And these aren't even advanced algos...fun times!

### Day 66: February 9th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**:  I fix the factoring loop! 

**Thoughts** It's crazy, I couldn't figure out what was wrong yesterday to save my freaking life. Today I instantly noticed that one line was messed up, quick fix and bam shazam, it works like a charm. Also made it faster with few tweaks! Amazing! Man, when things work, you feel like you are on top of the world, but when they don't ... oh Lord, you are in the pits, and there is no light in the proverbial tunnel. 
Anyway, enough for today. Quick session.
