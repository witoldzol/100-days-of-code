### Day 62: February 5th, Sunder	

**Today's Progress**: Completely stuck

**Thoughts** Stressed and dejected. Private life is completely overshadowing coding at the moment. I need to get things done before I can get back on track.

### Day 64: February 7th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**: I decided to 'lift' a solution from stackoverflow and analyse it. 

**Thoughts** I will not get bogged down and waste time trying to reinvent the wheel. I will analyse other people's code and learn from it. I've submitted application, levels of stress plumeted down. I can resume work!

### Day 65: February 8th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**: 'Almost' figured out how to prime factorize numbers

**Thoughts** It would seem that fun and games are over. Algorithms revolve around maths, and I am crumbling underneath the complexity of these easy mathematical problems. I say easy, but I find them hard, even though I know objectivly that they are simple math problems. I just don't have practice in solving these kinds of problems in programming. It whole different game, than solving math problems on paper. I feel I will be stuck for a while. And these aren't even advanced algos...fun times!

### Day 66: February 9th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**:  I fix the factoring loop! 

**Thoughts** It's crazy, I couldn't figure out what was wrong yesterday to save my freaking life. Today I instantly noticed that one line was messed up, quick fix and bam shazam, it works like a charm. Also made it faster with few tweaks! Amazing! Man, when things work, you feel like you are on top of the world, but when they don't ... oh Lord, you are in the pits, and there is no light in the proverbial tunnel. 
Anyway, enough for today. Quick session.

### Day 67: February 10th, Friday	

**Today's Progress**:  No progress. Stuck on object comparison.

**Thoughts** Every time I FEEL I don't know how to do something, I get stuck. I stop trying to solve the problem and simply retreat. Apathy, dejection and learned helplesness. I need to learn how to break down things. How to make them simplier, otherwise I will have a hard time getting anything done long term...life...term.

### Day 68: February 11th, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**:  Did bit of research into objects. No progress

**Thoughts** Today was a relaxing day. I've done a bit of reading, bit of youtube, took a stab at the object comparison. Nothing realy achieved or learned, but still good day. I'm positive. I had fun playing board game, overall pleasent day. Trying to stay in the moment I guess. I notice a frustration simmering underneath my skin. I explode easily and I've got dickhead responsens a lot of times. No idea why. Is it because of procrastination? Could be. I'd like to work on coding habit again. Start at specific time, establish cue to enhance habit. Keep reinforcing it.
