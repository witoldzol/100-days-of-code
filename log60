### Day 61: February 4th, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**: Practiced callback functions

**Thoughts** I'd drunk and tired. Thats it

### Day 62: February 5th, Sunder	

**Today's Progress**: Completely stuck

**Thoughts** Stressed and dejected. Private life is completely overshadowing coding at the moment. I need to get things done before I can get back on track.

### Day 63: February 6th, Monday	

**Today's Progress**: Still nothing done.

**Thoughts** Stress at max levels. Finished 'gathering' documentation. I'm submitting tomorrow.

### Day 64: February 7th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**: I decided to 'lift' a solution from stackoverflow and analyse it. 

**Thoughts** I will not get bogged down and waste time trying to reinvent the wheel. I will analyse other people's code and learn from it. I've submitted application, levels of stress plumeted down. I can resume work!

### Day 65: February 8th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**: 'Almost' figured out how to prime factorize numbers

**Thoughts** It would seem that fun and games are over. Algorithms revolve around maths, and I am crumbling underneath the complexity of these easy mathematical problems. I say easy, but I find them hard, even though I know objectivly that they are simple math problems. I just don't have practice in solving these kinds of problems in programming. It whole different game, than solving math problems on paper. I feel I will be stuck for a while. And these aren't even advanced algos...fun times!

### Day 66: February 9th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**:  I fix the factoring loop! 

**Thoughts** It's crazy, I couldn't figure out what was wrong yesterday to save my freaking life. Today I instantly noticed that one line was messed up, quick fix and bam shazam, it works like a charm. Also made it faster with few tweaks! Amazing! Man, when things work, you feel like you are on top of the world, but when they don't ... oh Lord, you are in the pits, and there is no light in the proverbial tunnel. 
Anyway, enough for today. Quick session.

### Day 67: February 10th, Friday	

**Today's Progress**:  No progress. Stuck on object comparison.

**Thoughts** Every time I FEEL I don't know how to do something, I get stuck. I stop trying to solve the problem and simply retreat. Apathy, dejection and learned helplesness. I need to learn how to break down things. How to make them simplier, otherwise I will have a hard time getting anything done long term...life...term.

### Day 68: February 11th, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**:  Did bit of research into objects. No progress

**Thoughts** Today was a relaxing day. I've done a bit of reading, bit of youtube, took a stab at the object comparison. Nothing realy achieved or learned, but still good day. I'm positive. I had fun playing board game, overall pleasent day. Trying to stay in the moment I guess. I notice a frustration simmering underneath my skin. I explode easily and I've got dickhead responsens a lot of times. No idea why. Is it because of procrastination? Could be. I'd like to work on coding habit again. Start at specific time, establish cue to enhance habit. Keep reinforcing it.

### Day 69: March 12th, Sunday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished prime factoring loop for multiple numbers [nested loop]

**Thoughts** Yes! I did it, finally figured out what to do. I had to read the problem again, realised it is far more complex than I thought, wated to give up. Seriously! But then I realised that I just need to break it down, and I can do this! Efficacy. Anyway, I had a thought, maybe all I have to do is find prime factors for all numbers, and somehow it will all add up magically. I took an old fashioned piece of paper and pen, and did what my math teacher from DIT taught me. Test it, step by step, see where it leads you. Well, turns out it led me to an answer. Yes, it did add up! So all I had to do was to nest my original loop inside another one that would go through all the numbers. Took me ages, because I missed one variable, but hey...it wouldn't be a coding evening if I didn't miss a proverbial semicolon. Anyway, I'm nearly there. Now I have to figure out how to filter the prime numbers, and we are done!

### Day 70: March 13th, Monday	

**Today's Progress**:  No progress.

**Thoughts** Too tired and dejected to write today (written the following day). I am loosing this battle, battle against myself...against bad habits. I'll be damn if I will stop fighting though! One, two, even hundred lost battles will not stop me from winning this war.

### Day 71: March 14th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Re learned how to remove duplicates from an array.

**Thoughts** It's highly demoralising when you realise that you don't remember how to do basic staff that you did a month ago. But there is only one person to judge me on that, and that's myself. What good will it do to me to get down, and bemoan the fact that most of the stuff I learned didn't 'stick' ? Of course it didn't stick! I've done moste of this stuff only once, and never revisited it again. There's no way I could remember. Insted I should be overjoyed at the fact that I vaguely remember doing something like that. Also, keeping notes, like I've done, payed off handsomly, because all I needed to do today, was to look up my prevoius algorithms and vouila! Duplicate removal code at my feet, ready to rock and roll! So let's get real here, and stop putting ourselves down. Coding is all about grit, not math, not iq, just plain old persistance and daily work! We are not on schedule, we are not in a rush! I'm not racing anybody but my own ego. I gotta keep reminding myself why I'm coding in the first place, and that is to fullfill my hearts desire to learn indefinitely and to create something out of 'nothing'! To have skills that can alter my, and my fellow people, lifes in a positive way! So stay calm, and keep coding. 4321§§

### Day 72: March 15th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished 'Find Smallest Common Multiple' algorithm

**Thoughts** It happened! Holly cow, I still can't believe it! I did it, this was, by far, the most complex, and challanging algo so far. Over 100 lines! And I did use shortcuts, like, I didn't bother implementing previous algo (used to find prime numbers), but simply used array of primes. Wow...simply wow! Even bigger wow came to me at work today, when I tried algos after that one (turns out you don't have to do them in order). I solved one with ONE LINE, another one with THREE LINES. It's like...not quite...even difficulty level. But hey, fuck it. I'm going forward, and that's what matters. Also, I am capable of nesting three loops one inside another one, and actually not loose track of what the hell is going on. Damn, I'm actually quite impressed with myself. Ha! Side note: I played tennis before coding. There's a good chance that physicall activity before coding infused me with more focus and allowed me to finish this algo today.
