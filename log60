### Day 62: February 5th, Sunder	

**Today's Progress**: Completely stuck

**Thoughts** Stressed and dejected. Private life is completely overshadowing coding at the moment. I need to get things done before I can get back on track.

### Day 64: February 7th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**: I decided to 'lift' a solution from stackoverflow and analyse it. 

**Thoughts** I will not get bogged down and waste time trying to reinvent the wheel. I will analyse other people's code and learn from it. I've submitted application, levels of stress plumeted down. I can resume work!
