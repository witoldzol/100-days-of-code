### Day 31: February 2st, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**: Added ajax call to return searched channel. Updated function that check if channel is online. Got stuck as it keeps returning undefined value.

**Thoughts** I have no idea what I'm doing. I have no idea how these freaking functions work! It's so inefficient to learn like this. Someone could just save me hours by pointing out...'hey this function does this and that and that's why this and that is happening'. But alas, there is noone out there, so I continue bashing my head into the keyboard. Now I realise I sound bitchy, and that's not the case. I'm enjoing myself. It's just afterthought, that I could learn so much faster. But hey, who cares?

### Day 32: February 3st, Friday	

**Today's Progress**: Learned about 'Closures', and managed to pull variable from function outside of it. Yay. Sorted out searching for channels, and placeholder message when channel doesn't exist. Effectively, I finished all required functinalities. 

**Thoughts** Another project finished! Wow...well, not yet. Got functionality, so now it's time to style...omg! I tremble at mere thought haha. Ah well, practice makes perfect right? I'll make this one look nice as well. By 'nice' I mean not fugly. I'm bit upset though. I read this article about this guy who went from zero to a hero in less than a year as a designer. Gist of the story...he worked 25h a day...slept 1h per month..and he could do that because he discovered his 'passion'. So, me sitting here, checking clock after 30 minutes and going 'ahhhhh' means that coding aint my passion? It's very demoralising. I gotta stop reading these bullshit stories. I mean kudos to the guy, but fok off.

### Day 33: February 4st, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**: Updated css. Styled search bar. Fixed markup.

**Thoughts** I've been playing games and drinking all day. After I finished I just wanted to go to bed...but I couldn't without putting in at least 30 minutes. I knew I wouldn't achieve much but I still had to. I need this, I gotta keep going. It's all I've got. I can't go back to drifting aimlessly.

### Day 34: February 5th, Sunday	

**Today's Progress**: Second day of CSS. Applied Bootstrap's row/column responsive design. Trying to figure out how to align paragraphs in displayed containers.

**Thoughts** Ohhh CSS why you so cruel? Such a fickle lady. Even Freud couldn't figure out what is it that you want, how to make you happy. What scrifice do you require of me!?

### Day 35: February 6th, Monday	

**Today's Progress**: Thirds day of CSS. Trying to align text with image. I  think I found a solution. Creating wrapper div, and using bootstrap's columns and rows.

**Thoughts** I am setting myself up for failure. I keep delaying coding until its very late, I'm pushing myself in order to make mylef either fail at coding or to pay the price of loosing sleep. Solution? Go back to 'religious' observation of 6pm rule! It has a profound impact on all my productivity. If I code whenever I end up procrastinating until its very late. And because I start late I can only put absolute minimum. If I stick to strict time I can orginse my affairs in advance and I can put in more hours in, because once I start I actually enjoy myslef. So yea. We know what to do. Will we do it tho?

### Day 36: February 7th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**: Fourth day of CSS. I figured out how to make text align with image and be responsive. 

**Thoughts** Fuck my life. Fuck css. Holly crap I'm having a time of my life. Trying, failing, trying some more. Damn it's frustrating but I'm slowly plowing through this. I'm learning, slowly but surely. I will make it responsive and awesome looging! God damn. Also, today I learned that less is more. I discarded all the wrapper div's and used a simple <p> tag to grab all elements. Simples, works, I'm happy.

### Day 38: February 9th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**: No progress. Still cannot pass variable from ajax call.

**Thoughts** Today was a great day. I've made a cool macro at work, then another one...tons of fun. At home, I decided to do research before going back to the issue of variable scope. Few youtube vids later I was ready to take on the world. 3 hours later it still won't work. I'm not even mad, interestingly I feel good. I didn't achieve anything tangible, but I guess I learned stuff, and that's good enough. I still don't understand the whole scope etc., otherwise I would have figured this problem out. But hey, steady does it. I'll be back tomorrow, and the day after, undill callbacks, scopes and whatever the fok javascript has in it's pockets, will become clear! Onwards and upwards, hey ho!!

### Day 39: February 10th, Friday	

**Today's Progress**: Finished online/offline check.

**Thoughts** Oh God! I did it, after three...four days! I never found out what was wrong with that ajax scope and why on earth it wouldn't pass the variable. But it doesn't matter. I realised I implemented perfectly fine online/offline check before...and forgot all about it! Insane. I spend four days pulling hair out of my freaking head over a problem to which I had already made a solution. Oh well, at least I learned about scope and stuff. My understanding is that deeper, and app is finished....just gotta do CSS...again.
So happy. Damn, this is why I code!

### Day 40: February 11th, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**: Finished twitchAPP!!!. I've applied simple, responsive, bootstrap powered design. Sleek :)

**Thoughts** Oh yea! Ohhhh yea!!! Done and done. Howly crap. I must have spent today 5 hours just hacking away at css. And it was fun! I still can't make stuff look professional but I'm getting there. Feeling good. I'd say enough for today though. Tomorrow back to algorithms!
