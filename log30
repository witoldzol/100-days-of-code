### Day 31: February 2st, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**: Added ajax call to return searched channel. Updated function that check if channel is online. Got stuck as it keeps returning undefined value.

**Thoughts** I have no idea what I'm doing. I have no idea how these freaking functions work! It's so inefficient to learn like this. Someone could just save me hours by pointing out...'hey this function does this and that and that's why this and that is happening'. But alas, there is noone out there, so I continue bashing my head into the keyboard. Now I realise I sound bitchy, and that's not the case. I'm enjoing myself. It's just afterthought, that I could learn so much faster. But hey, who cares?

### Day 32: February 3st, Friday	

**Today's Progress**: Learned about 'Closures', and managed to pull variable from function outside of it. Yay. Sorted out searching for channels, and placeholder message when channel doesn't exist. Effectively, I finished all required functinalities. 

**Thoughts** Another project finished! Wow...well, not yet. Got functionality, so now it's time to style...omg! I tremble at mere thought haha. Ah well, practice makes perfect right? I'll make this one look nice as well. By 'nice' I mean not fugly. I'm bit upset though. I read this article about this guy who went from zero to a hero in less than a year as a designer. Gist of the story...he worked 25h a day...slept 1h per month..and he could do that because he discovered his 'passion'. So, me sitting here, checking clock after 30 minutes and going 'ahhhhh' means that coding aint my passion? It's very demoralising. I gotta stop reading these bullshit stories. I mean kudos to the guy, but fok off.
