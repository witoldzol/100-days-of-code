### Day 31: February 2st, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**: Added ajax call to return searched channel. Updated function that check if channel is online. Got stuck as it keeps returning undefined value.

**Thoughts** I have no idea what I'm doing. I have no idea how these freaking functions work! It's so inefficient to learn like this. Someone could just save me hours by pointing out...'hey this function does this and that and that's why this and that is happening'. But alas, there is noone out there, so I continue bashing my head into the keyboard. Now I realise I sound bitchy, and that's not the case. I'm enjoing myself. It's just afterthought, that I could learn so much faster. But hey, who cares?

### Day 32: February 3st, Friday	

**Today's Progress**: Learned about 'Closures', and managed to pull variable from function outside of it. Yay. Sorted out searching for channels, and placeholder message when channel doesn't exist. Effectively, I finished all required functinalities. 

**Thoughts** Another project finished! Wow...well, not yet. Got functionality, so now it's time to style...omg! I tremble at mere thought haha. Ah well, practice makes perfect right? I'll make this one look nice as well. By 'nice' I mean not fugly. I'm bit upset though. I read this article about this guy who went from zero to a hero in less than a year as a designer. Gist of the story...he worked 25h a day...slept 1h per month..and he could do that because he discovered his 'passion'. So, me sitting here, checking clock after 30 minutes and going 'ahhhhh' means that coding aint my passion? It's very demoralising. I gotta stop reading these bullshit stories. I mean kudos to the guy, but fok off.

### Day 33: February 4st, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**: Updated css. Styled search bar. Fixed markup.

**Thoughts** I've been playing games and drinking all day. After I finished I just wanted to go to bed...but I couldn't without putting in at least 30 minutes. I knew I wouldn't achieve much but I still had to. I need this, I gotta keep going. It's all I've got. I can't go back to drifting aimlessly.

### Day 34: February 5th, Sunday	

**Today's Progress**: Second day of CSS. Applied Bootstrap's row/column responsive design. Trying to figure out how to align paragraphs in displayed containers.

**Thoughts** Ohhh CSS why you so cruel? Such a fickle lady. Even Freud couldn't figure out what is it that you want, how to make you happy. What scrifice do you require of me!?

### Day 35: February 6th, Monday	

**Today's Progress**: Thirds day of CSS. Trying to align text with image. I  think I found a solution. Creating wrapper div, and using bootstrap's columns and rows.

**Thoughts** I am setting myself up for failure. I keep delaying coding until its very late, I'm pushing myself in order to make mylef either fail at coding or to pay the price of loosing sleep. Solution? Go back to 'religious' observation of 6pm rule! It has a profound impact on all my productivity. If I code whenever I end up procrastinating until its very late. And because I start late I can only put absolute minimum. If I stick to strict time I can orginse my affairs in advance and I can put in more hours in, because once I start I actually enjoy myslef. So yea. We know what to do. Will we do it tho?

### Day 36: February 7th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**: Fourth day of CSS. I figured out how to make text align with image and be responsive. 

**Thoughts** Fuck my life. Fuck css. Holly crap I'm having a time of my life. Trying, failing, trying some more. Damn it's frustrating but I'm slowly plowing through this. I'm learning, slowly but surely. I will make it responsive and awesome looging! God damn. Also, today I learned that less is more. I discarded all the wrapper div's and used a simple <p> tag to grab all elements. Simples, works, I'm happy.
