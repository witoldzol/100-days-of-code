### Day 31: February 2st, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**: Added ajax call to return searched channel. Updated function that check if channel is online. Got stuck as it keeps returning undefined value.

**Thoughts** I have no idea what I'm doing. I have no idea how these freaking functions work! It's so inefficient to learn like this. Someone could just save me hours by pointing out...'hey this function does this and that and that's why this and that is happening'. But alas, there is noone out there, so I continue bashing my head into the keyboard. Now I realise I sound bitchy, and that's not the case. I'm enjoing myself. It's just afterthought, that I could learn so much faster. But hey, who cares?

### Day 32: February 3st, Friday	

**Today's Progress**: Learned about 'Closures', and managed to pull variable from function outside of it. Yay. Sorted out searching for channels, and placeholder message when channel doesn't exist. Effectively, I finished all required functinalities. 

**Thoughts** Another project finished! Wow...well, not yet. Got functionality, so now it's time to style...omg! I tremble at mere thought haha. Ah well, practice makes perfect right? I'll make this one look nice as well. By 'nice' I mean not fugly. I'm bit upset though. I read this article about this guy who went from zero to a hero in less than a year as a designer. Gist of the story...he worked 25h a day...slept 1h per month..and he could do that because he discovered his 'passion'. So, me sitting here, checking clock after 30 minutes and going 'ahhhhh' means that coding aint my passion? It's very demoralising. I gotta stop reading these bullshit stories. I mean kudos to the guy, but fok off.

### Day 33: February 4st, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**: Updated css. Styled search bar. Fixed markup.

**Thoughts** I've been playing games and drinking all day. After I finished I just wanted to go to bed...but I couldn't without putting in at least 30 minutes. I knew I wouldn't achieve much but I still had to. I need this, I gotta keep going. It's all I've got. I can't go back to drifting aimlessly.

### Day 34: February 5th, Sunday	

**Today's Progress**: Second day of CSS. Applied Bootstrap's row/column responsive design. Trying to figure out how to align paragraphs in displayed containers.

**Thoughts** Ohhh CSS why you so cruel? Such a fickle lady. Even Freud couldn't figure out what is it that you want, how to make you happy. What scrifice do you require of me!?

### Day 35: February 6th, Monday	

**Today's Progress**: Thirds day of CSS. Trying to align text with image. I  think I found a solution. Creating wrapper div, and using bootstrap's columns and rows.

**Thoughts** I am setting myself up for failure. I keep delaying coding until its very late, I'm pushing myself in order to make mylef either fail at coding or to pay the price of loosing sleep. Solution? Go back to 'religious' observation of 6pm rule! It has a profound impact on all my productivity. If I code whenever I end up procrastinating until its very late. And because I start late I can only put absolute minimum. If I stick to strict time I can orginse my affairs in advance and I can put in more hours in, because once I start I actually enjoy myslef. So yea. We know what to do. Will we do it tho?

### Day 36: February 7th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**: Fourth day of CSS. I figured out how to make text align with image and be responsive. 

**Thoughts** Fuck my life. Fuck css. Holly crap I'm having a time of my life. Trying, failing, trying some more. Damn it's frustrating but I'm slowly plowing through this. I'm learning, slowly but surely. I will make it responsive and awesome looging! God damn. Also, today I learned that less is more. I discarded all the wrapper div's and used a simple <p> tag to grab all elements. Simples, works, I'm happy.

### Day 37: February 8th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**: NOTHING

**Thoughts** FUCK THIS. FUCK FUNCTION SCOPE. IM WASTING TIME!!!!!!!!

### Day 38: February 9th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**: No progress. Still cannot pass variable from ajax call.

**Thoughts** Today was a great day. I've made a cool macro at work, then another one...tons of fun. At home, I decided to do research before going back to the issue of variable scope. Few youtube vids later I was ready to take on the world. 3 hours later it still won't work. I'm not even mad, interestingly I feel good. I didn't achieve anything tangible, but I guess I learned stuff, and that's good enough. I still don't understand the whole scope etc., otherwise I would have figured this problem out. But hey, steady does it. I'll be back tomorrow, and the day after, undill callbacks, scopes and whatever the fok javascript has in it's pockets, will become clear! Onwards and upwards, hey ho!!

### Day 39: February 10th, Friday	

**Today's Progress**: Finished online/offline check.

**Thoughts** Oh God! I did it, after three...four days! I never found out what was wrong with that ajax scope and why on earth it wouldn't pass the variable. But it doesn't matter. I realised I implemented perfectly fine online/offline check before...and forgot all about it! Insane. I spend four days pulling hair out of my freaking head over a problem to which I had already made a solution. Oh well, at least I learned about scope and stuff. My understanding is that deeper, and app is finished....just gotta do CSS...again.
So happy. Damn, this is why I code!

### Day 40: February 11th, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**: Finished twitchAPP!!!. I've applied simple, responsive, bootstrap powered design. Sleek :)

**Thoughts** Oh yea! Ohhhh yea!!! Done and done. Howly crap. I must have spent today 5 hours just hacking away at css. And it was fun! I still can't make stuff look professional but I'm getting there. Feeling good. I'd say enough for today though. Tomorrow back to algorithms!

### Day 41: February 12th, Sunday	

**Today's Progress**: Solved first intermediate alogithm.

**Thoughts** I slept most of the day, and watched you tube. Took it easy, although I'm not sure if that is a good idea. I don't think I'll brake or something if I enjoy my time solving those algos'.

### Day 42: February 13th, Monday	

**Today's Progress**: "Nearly solved second algo..nearly"

**Thoughts** Another lazy day. I've failed in trying to export variables using javascript and pass it somehow to autohotkey script. Took a break, nap, youtube. Took a swing at the second alorithm on FCC, managed to find non duplicate, but because I turned array into object, numbers got stringified, and ... oh...I really don't feel like I'm learning. I'm just lifting stuff from stackoverflow, but I have no idea how and why things happen. Oh well, gotta keep punching, and hope that some of it will get into my skull. Happy days.

### Day 43: February 14th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**: No progress on solution. I moved away from object based solution, which resulted in pretty epic logical failure on my side. 

**Thoughts** Slept most of the day again. I am procrastinating, and I'm not sure why. I still fail to adhere to 6pm rule, which ends up biting me in the ass. I feel overwhelmed again, so I escape. Tomarrow is another day, we will regrup and try again, and again, and again, untill something will give. Grit is the differentiator.

### Day 44: February 15th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**: Back to object oriented approach. I cannot differentiate between numbers and strings to save my life. That's the only things that's left. 

**Thoughts** I've started early today, well...earlier than usual. In the end I ended up very frustrated. I'm almost done, yet the answer eludes me. My brain feels cloudy, I do not make connections, just keep typing and trying out things blindly. Obviously, results are quite jarring (whatever that word means). I'm really tired. Time to call it a day. Somehow, I belive, tomorrow answer will come to me.

### Day 45: February 16th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**: Finished second algorithm!(remove duplicates)

**Thoughts** I was slacking today, chatting, watching movie...left coding for last. When it finally worked I actually cried out like a little kid that got a surprise present! Omg, wow...WOW! That a real battle. Can't wait to start this nightmare all over again! HaHa.

### Day 46: February 17th, Friday	

**Today's Progress**: Finished third algorithm!(convert arabic numbers to roman)

**Thoughts** Again, I was procrastinating hard today! I only started coding around 9pm. I decided that I will not spend days trying to figure out logic of roman alphabet on my own and how best go about it. I simply googled 'roman numbers logic' and got generic article on how to break them down. No code, no nothin, just logic, and best approach from perspective of computers. That was all I needed!
I can't believe how smooth it all went. Although I did use very simple expressions and functions. Still, no major hickkups, or annoying foken missing semicolons. Smooth ride. Good day!

### Day 47: February 18th, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**: Watched tutorial on object and object classes

**Thoughts** We played games today, but it turned out to be a total disaster. People didn't understand rules, game turned out to be way to complex for most folks. Worst ever, was that even after we played few more rounds people still didn't get the basic strategy inherent in the game. I was very buthurt aobut that fact, given that I was the only person who knew the rules, it made things considerably more difficult for me. I ddin't have the patience to explain....I don't know why..just...lost myself. I wasted all day waiting for his game, and now it turned out to be an utter dissapointment. I;m done. I dont wanna reapeat this bullshit again. No more games. Just me and code on in weekend. thats it. bye

### Day 48: February 19th, Sunday	

**Today's Progress**: Barely scratched code today. Tested few options. Still no idea what I'm doing with objects.

**Thoughts** I don't know what to do, and I have no confidence on how to manipulate objects. I'm glad that I've got a challange like that because it offers great opportunity to finally consolidate and actualy learn how to implement knowledge on objects. This is very important, and I want to make sure that I've got this firmly in my pocket. I've spent literally whole day in bed watching Korean Tv show. No regreats, great show. No regrets! So I didn't get to do any proper coding? Oh well, weekends are tough, despite being so easy. It's complicated. Anyhow, tomorrow is another day! We will crush. Most likely. Hopefully. Fighting!

### Day 49: February 20th, Monday	

**Today's Progress**: Tried to use Object.is method, but no joy.

**Thoughts** I'm loosing motivation. I'm feeling down. I completely neglect 6pm, postpone recklessly, don't care. It's as if I was loosing hope. It doen't make any sense. Things are good, I'm learning. Oh, I will march on. I want to go back to strict timing. There is freedom in discipline. Hey Ho!

### Day 50: February 21th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to loop through object properties and compare them with another object properties

**Thoughts** Again weak day. I gotta keep going! I gotta rally!

**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/intermed.algorithms][]

### Day 51: February 22th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to compare object property and values in single statement

**Thoughts** Yet another lazy day, I am procrastinating to the extreme. I will be patient with myself. I recognize that this algorithm makes me feel overwhelmed. Because I don't know what to do and have no idea how to progress, I feel pressure and run away from it, hence procrastination. I have to be patient with myself. This is not a race, but a psychological, and emotional struggle. Algorithm is already solved, all I have to do, is to allow myself to reach for the solution. All is well. 

**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/intermed.algorithms][]

### Day 52: February 23th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**: No progress

**Thoughts** Stuck. I can loop through object and compare properties and values, but what then? I have to check if another element is in object...and I don't know how. Loop within loop. I can barely think straight about this. I feel dejected, how little I know, how little I understand, and the worse I feel the less I work. Dysmal.

### Day 53: February 24th, Friday	

**Today's Progress**: No progress. Again

**Thoughts** Stuck. Dejected. Didn't go out. Stayed all day/night in bed. Simply depressed. My real life pressures are impacting me, and keeping pinned down. It's just a matter of time before we drop out of the coding challange and go on a downward spiral. We've been there so many times...

**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/intermed.algorithms][]

### Day 54: February 25th, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**: I didn't code today.

**Thoughts** I hit the ground last day(I'm writing this on Sunday). I coudn't lift a finger. Depression and apathy pinned me down. My personal problems are spilling into coding.

### Day 54: February 25th, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**: Finished fourth algorithm!!!!!

**Thoughts** I've been procrastinating all day, finally I pulled myself together for last rally and ... lo and behold, I figured out how to solve the problem. Inch by inch, iteration by iteration I pieced it together. Turns out last bit of solution took 3 lines to deal with it. Nearly a week to get solution with THREE lines of code. Amazing. I will not give up. Everytime I will go down, I will rally and get up. I don't care how long it will take, I don't care how others are doint, I don't care if this is feasable. I reject any notion of failure. I will persevere!
