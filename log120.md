### Day 121: May 15th, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  I've worked on vba macro - additional deletions.

**Thoughts**  I want to spend less time working at work and focus on developing macro in vba. It's very important and can save a ton of time for us. Also, if I manage to implement it and get it pass official approval, it's something that I can put on my 'cv'. Clear goal ahead, gotta push! I feel very lazy, it's difficult to get up and get going. I want to change that, I want to realise my potential. I don't want to live in fear for the rest of my life.

### Day 122: May 16th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  Vba macro: export file to new workbook and close open workbooks.

**Thoughts**  I've spent all afternoon and evening at the grill party. Good times. Coded for an hour at work.

### Day 123: May 17th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  No coding today. Busy at work.

**Thoughts**  I was late for work so I had to crank it up. Also gotta do some extra stuff so busy busy. I'm thinking about solution for TnE department which would require webscraping or something of that sort. I'd like to scrape all images and displayed them in a gui as thumbnails or something like that. That would be pretty damn sweet. Keep on dreaming...

### Day 124: May 18th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Again, no coding.

**Thoughts**  I lost control of myself. Whenever I come back home...it's over. There is huge resistance to doing anything. All I want to do is lie down in my bed and watch youtube mindlessly. Not sure how to break this. I guess I need a ...what you call it, a pattern. I could make dinner, prepare everything...and then take a shower...that would be a good que. Study every day after shower. That might work.

### Day 125: May 19th, Friday

**Today's Progress**:  No code.

**Thoughts**  Left work early. Made some dinner, went over for a grill. And that was the whole day. Nothing achieved, because I don't want to say no to Bart. But he doesn't need me to be there. I don't have to stay all the way. I can always get out early and grab an hour or two of coding. Or even better, I can plan ahead, get code in early and have the rest of the day for myself. Sounds good on paper. Now, I gotta apply. Start slow, take small victories, no need to get discourage early. Be mindful, and keep at it. Bit ty bit, towards a realisation of potential.

### Day 126: May 20th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  Working on vlookup in vba.

**Thoughts**  I woke up at 5am. My new routine, I hope. I'll study italian, vietnamese, and if i fell like it, spanish. Wow right? And I do know not to overburden myself, to go easy at the start! I read the research, I know the facts, and yet, here we are. 3 languages at one time. How do I justify it? Well, I don't want to learn, learn, languages. For example, I'd be happy if I learn vietnamese to the level of my current italian. Where's the bathroom, no meat please, etc. No pressure. I don't intend to learn the whole thing, that's crazy, this language is the weirdest thing ever. Random letters in random order, there is literally no point of reference whatsoever. But again, days go by. One by one, and they turn into months and years. I just want to chip away silently at these languages, so one day I would wake up and realise that I can communicate in these languages should need occur. It feels like 'languages for free', in other words, I don't want to put any effort into this. No 'power drilling, no minmaxing'. That would require too much energy, too much motivation....it would reaquire a WHY that resonates with my core values, and that is not the case when it comes to learning languages. It's just something that sounds 'cool to do/know'.

### Day 127: May 21th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  Looked at code...literally.

**Thoughts**  I refuse to feel bad about procrastination. Feeling bad will not help, quite the contrary. It will only slow me down. I know it feels like we are not moving forward, heck, feels like we are going backwards. That's normal, and it's part of the process. What process? Process of becoming. Why am I obsessed with becoming 'better' and getting more? I have so much. Why can't I just be satisfied with who I am, who I became already? My goals...desires havent changed, but the motives underlying them did. I did use to feel insufficient, very imperfect. I wanted to be perfect, made whole....I realize how dangerous fantasy that is. I will not deny that I've entertained it for years. So what changed? Have I trancended my suffering, my self critique? Yes, do a degree. I'm ok with 'good enough' these days. Also, I try to become, because I pursue the process not the end goal. Freedom comes dyscipline, and I've always desired it. Whether I realised it or not.

### Day 128: May 22th, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  Researched vlookup for vba

**Thoughts**  I'm finding it hard to hack vlookup between multiple workbooks in vba. The fact that I have no idea what I'm doing is not helping! I resist sitting down and patiently going learning basics in order to abstract to higher level of complexity. I just want to quickly hack (copy paste) a bunch of lines of code that will get shit done and forget about it. So I'm at the crossroads. Also, I am putting everything into one subroutine...which I'm guessing is pretty horrible practice. I mean, spaghetti code is real. I'll just leave it as is and start new sub that will handle vlookup. I am not working on freecodecamp. Havent looked at the ... LAST ... algo in ages. All I gotta do is wrap it up and move on to projects, and that's it! But noooooo...here I am hacking some vba macro God knows what the fuck for. Ah well. Happy birthday to myself! I hit 35 years today, my solemn decision is to quit smokes, for real. I've spent last 17 years smoking. I owe it to myself to be done with it. I will do as I decided. No excuses.

### Day 129: May 23th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on 10th advanced algo 

**Thoughts**  Busy day, both at work and after. I woke up at 5am, did my language lessons. Got up, did kettlebells, ate breakfast, packed. I pushed production at work, finished extra assignments, helped other team...jeeezaz, even found time to attent horrible meeting about lgbt and inclusivness and all that garbage. After work I must have spent 3 hours at Marcins place fighting with his goddamn computer which simply refuses to work. Well we made progress, it turns on and stuff showes up on screen so I guess its something. Anyhow, turned out we didn't need to buy new psu. So I ended up with his old power supply, which means I've got a computer again. Like a real computer. Linux baby! Wow, long day. While I was eating my supper, I reflected on passed day, and thought to myself...holy shit we did a lot. Like...I remember myself from back in a day, and the difference in energy and 'motivation' and very visible. Hope. (My ex texted me birthday wishes, I do miss her..)

### Day 130: May 24th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  Finished subroutine in vba macro

**Thoughts**  Good progress on vba macro. I've closed off another subroutine and managed to export file path while saving the file. Pretty awesome, very happy with that. It's smooth and unobtrusive. Tomorrow I'm moving to vlookup and allocating names. I've left a meeting with my bosses boss. Boring af, words cannot describe how pointless and wastful those meetings are with execs / higher managers. 

**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]


### Day 131: May 25th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Vba: basic vlookup finished

**Thoughts**  Things are taking time. We played tennis today, we sucked hard. Weather was amazing though. I'm not getting enough sleep I think. I'm not tired...but I have a feeling I need more sleep. I have been waking up earlier, but I keep going to bed at the usual time, which results in serious sleep deficiency (comperatively). Ah well, we are testing things out. Lets not jump to conclusions.

### Day 132-3: May 26-7th, Friday and Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  No coding done. 

**Thoughts**  I drank quite a bit of alcohol over the past two days. I was too drunk to even make a log on Friday. We had a good heart to heart drinking session with Bart. I came clean with my lies, felt good. It aint easy, but damn it is liberating. Now I don't have to pretend to be someone I'm not. Again, win. And who am I? I'm an aspiring engineer, that's how I'll think about myself. Yesterday I spent most of the day in bed watching Peterson's lectures. In one of the lectures he spoke about St George who kills a dragon. He explained the symbolic message: man ventures out into the chaos and confront's it (in the form of dragon). As a result he gets a hand of a maiden. This metaphore reminded me of my own limitation, and when later on my hause mate asked me out to go out to the night club...i said yes. I felt I had no choice, the timing of everything and all. Also I do feel bad about not supporting my housemate who has been struggling for so long to find a girlfriend. ( if you ask me you don't look for a gf in a nightclub but hey...what do I know). Anyway, we ventured out from the safe confines of our own prison in order not to get laid, but to shape our charcters into stronger one's. A hunting test, an expression of primordial need to play the game and to win. (and to become a better player by doing so -- not by winning but by merely playing...you know what I meant!)

## Day 134: May 28th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  No coding done. 

**Thoughts**  Quite a day. So I ventured yesterday into the chaos, to kill the dragon. And to my own surprise ... I did! In other words, I went out to a nightclub and asked a girl out. And she agreed.
Great, right? Well, yes, but...I didn't take my phone with me, so I didn't take her number. She said she didn't have a pen...so I said, I'll be back tomorrow if you are working. She said 'yes, from 11pm'.
Great! So I went over to Przemek's place today for his birthday party. Half the people didn't even turn up, including his own brother who was probably busy boning his housemates, very recent girlfriend. Needles to say, poor shmuck (the recently gilfriendless chap) was present at the party.Didn't matter, we had a jolly good time. 
We even managed to finish the party and get back to city excatly around 11pm! Perfect! So, on our way back home, I walk into yesterdays nightclub, take a quick tour...and fail to find her. One more tour..still nothing. I left.
Didn't say a word to my friend. Once I got back home...I couldn't just let it go. I needed to know! I dressed back up, and went back. This time, I asked the staff about her. Nobody knew her. Right....boy do I felt stupid. 
And that's how victory over the dragon got overshadowed by girly dodge. Ah well, life goes on.

## Day 135: May 29th, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  Nearly done with 10th algo

**Thoughts**  I'm making mistakes at TnE, I'm feeling pressure to finish the journals for accounts team, and more importantly, I haven't forgotten the girl. Did she really lied to me? Why? Did I really misread the situation so badly?
Doesn't matter! (I haven't decided yet if I will try again). What matters is that I code, and I did! So happy goddamn days! Finally.And to my surprise it went really well, almost like I haven't forgotten anything. Pretty cool. It just flowed. 
Bam, like a boss. That's it. That's all that matters in long term. There's plenty more dragons to kill out there, and virgins to be saved. Contempt for failure.

## Day 136: May 30th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  Learning how to use index callback within reduce()

**Thoughts**  At work angry people write angry emails to me. Fair enough. Weird but fine, I'll crush them with nice approach. And I did. 
After work, good tennis session, and a beer. After dinner, I went hunting dragons again. Same dragon. Didn't find it. I'm quite dissapointed again. The longer this goes on the lower the chance anything will come out of this one.
But than again, I can't just give up. I wouldn't feel good about it. I want to be hones and true with myself, and that means doing things that I don't want to do. Simples.


**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

## Day 137: May 31th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  No progress on reduce()

**Thoughts**  Really bussy at work, getting hammered by accounting stuff that I don't understand. It's quite annoying to be honest. But that again, it is a learning excercise so I can't complain.
I'm still in doubts about the whole girl thing. I keep going there, and she keeps not being there. Am I being persistent or foolish? I guess I'd rather be the latter as long as I don't have any regrets. 
It feels harder to be a fool, so my guess is that's the right thing to do.

## Day 138-9: June 1st/2nd, Thursday / Friday

**Today's Progress**:  Slow progress on 10th algo (3 out of 5)

**Thoughts**  Finally got my bearings back at work. I'm making progress both on vba macro and my final fcc algorithm. It's slow, but it beat's no progress at all, so I'll take it.
Still watching Peterson's youtube videos, they are eye opening. He trully has amazing charisma and ability to present dificult concept in an understantable way. He also synthethised a ton of stuff into very concise and actionalbe points.
I just finished coding for today, all that is left is to go to Check Inn ... again...and not find her...again. I'm starting to dread the day, I will actually find her. 
What if she doesn't remember? There is a way to think about this in very negative way, or realistic one with a rather negative outcome. I will not entertain that, because pragmatic thing to do is to take action and see what happens. 
Worst case scenario? I will survive this dissapointment, best...well, sky's the limit. Time to kill some dragons!

## Day 140: June 3rd, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  Finished last advanced algorithm!

**Thoughts**  Yes! Last algo done. To be honest it was very anti climatic ending. I changed one value to another..and bam. Just like that. NO idea what was wrong. But what the hell, I rolled with it. I kept busy today, all day! Shopping, laundry, cleaning, I finally finished Marcin's computer. All done today! My little latino phantasy also ended. I went tonight with Lukas, and she wasn't there. Everything else was exactly the same, same staff...except for her! Unbelivable. I have to admit that really hit me hard. I let her slip away, and I can't get over it now. Granted I'm making tremendous amount of assumptions that this whole thing would lead to anything at all. But still, I find it painful. It's like making a fortune and then loosing it the next day. It wouldn't be a problem if you believed that you can make a new one the next day, but that's just not the case with me. It will take me while to get over it. And you know what? I will take my bloody time.

## Day 141: June 4th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  Learned how to sync two computers to one git repo

**Thoughts**

## Day 142-3: June 5/6th, Monday / Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  Laid down basic html for my calculator project

**Thoughts**  I'm on the fence about some major thing in my life. I acutely realise I need to clarify my goals if I am to get anywhere in life. In order to do that I have to accept the risk of failure. But if I don't I already failed.

## Day 144-5: June 7/6th, Wednesday / Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Watched vba tutorials

**Thoughts**  The impossible happened, I got sick! I haven't been sick since I went vegan (excluding Vietnam). Feels bit dissapointing, but I won't dwell on it. Seen this guy on internetz ... mr ice man. Simple breathing technique...cold exposure. That's it. I want to implement this into my daily routine. So, breathing excercise in the morning before kettlebells. Then do the swings without breathing! I know, sounds crazy! So that's that. What else. I feel...I'm not sure how I feel. I'm hiding I guess, I feel this sickness is due to my mental state caused by recent events. Being acutely reminded of my own limitations, and not pursuing ways of breaking them ... it's painful. No matter what I do, misery follows, so there's no reason not to try then..right?! logically...right!!!? And yet here we are, bed ridden. Lukas, at whom I've looked down on often, has more guts than I do. I mean it, he might have his own limitation, but at least his trying. My god, he is, and inadvertantly tries to help me as well!

## Day 146: June 8th, Friday

**Today's Progress**:  No progress. Still sick

**Thoughts**  I'm reading a book on coming to terms with rejection and stuff like that. It will help across the board. Being able to set goals, means accepting a possibility of failure. Today I worked all day in order to pump up the numbers. Why? Because I could, and also because I didn't work yesterday so I felt obliged to make up for that. It's weird but being recognized by my manager made a huge difference. I feel more owenrship now, more responsibility. It also 'forces' me to do more, because now there's a higher standard that I need to maintain. Am I being played and work my ass off for some corpo? That's one way to look at it, I choose to see it as taking owenrship of my work and maintaining standard that I wish to carry throughout my life.

## Day 147: June 9th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  Still sick. Finished v-lookup/send email part of vba macro

**Thoughts**  I managed to install rosetta stone (finally). Downside is, it takes enormous amount of time! I don't think I can continue with current regimen of 3 languages at one time! I mean, I knew it's absurd when I started off, but then again it wasn't anything serious. Also I noticed my faith iswaivering. Do I really need vietnamese? Can I even learn basics given it's a tonal language?! Well, I'm not giving up just yet, just gotta figure out how to fit in rosetta stone in my schedule. Maybe before sleep? I could make that work. I went out today to watch a game with friends. I've seen few really gorgeous girls, and was hell bent on getting rejected that day. Unfortunatelly my best 'chance' left before game ended ( I was planning to ask her out after the game). Oh well, lesson learned, again. Dont wait, just act! Next, I'm getting interested in Wim Hof breathing method, and cold resistance training. Promise of enhanced immune system is very alluring. Also, I do lack cold ressistance, and get really annoyed when temperature is low. So that would be really helpful. Long story short, I'm doing it.

## Day 148: June 10th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  Even more sick! Researched classes in vba 

**Thoughts** I've decided to cut out vitnamese from the language rotation. That's it, too hard, too ... removed from reality. The idea to go and live there, not the language. Very little progress today. There are multiple possible issues with the allcoation macro. First: how to handle variables. Use bunch of separate variables? List, maybe an multidimensional array? Where are objects? Turns out that objects are classes....eeee, well classes are like..prototypes for creating custom objects. So, I'm thinking that's what I'll use to hold properties of each employee. Second: how to account for rolled over allocation? Calculate total items, divide by number of employees, get flat rate and assign it to each employees' property, then deduct from each employees' number the rolled forward amount. Third: how to allocate each OU equally (specifically india)? Identify number of OU's, pass it to a variable. Now two options: use custom filters and make individuall passes, or make some sort of hierarchical logic loop that goes through the whole list looking for target OU's. I'm guessing second approach would be far slower, but I don't like the idea of using filters either. Fourth: How to account for exceptions in training without breaking the loop (if I'm being allocated item, and next one is excluded for me, I get the next one...ok, but then comes another person, how do I go back to the skipped item?). That's all I could think of at this point. Something is telling me there's more to come. Fun times! (I'm actually enjoying myself with vba at this point - honey moon period with easy stuff).

## Day 149: June 11th, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  Researching classes

**Thoughts** Sooo..my initial idea was to create a object constructor and loop through names and generate required objects and populate their 
properties with relevant information. Well, it seems there is no such thing as object constructor. I mean, it must be there, i just can't find it / write it. I will have to accept that it will take more time than I anticipated (seriously?). The big thing today was the fact that I got overwhelmed, frustrated and walked away to watch tv shows. Well no surprise here, but the new thing is that I noticed! I mean, I know whats happening, now I need to implement strategy to couteract this behaviour. I gotta find a tool to fix my insta broken emotion when things don't go my way. It's absolutely vital! And for the first time I feel like I can do it!! Also...i hate github, seriously gettign repo going is such a fucking pain in the ass its unbelivable. every motherfucking time something goes wrong.

## Day 150: June 12th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  Researched collections / diaries in vba

**Thoughts** Ok, turns out creating bunch of objects is not the way to go, from what I can gather. I just use one object, populate properties, and dump it into collection/diary. I guess? I'll figure it out. It will be fun actually. Reining all of that in and creating something that works and relives real world issue (haha).
