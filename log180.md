## Day 1: July 1st, Monday

**Today's Progress**: New beginnings. Turns out we haven't coded in over a month. I'm starting new 100 day challange. Worked on pomodoro clock. 

**Thoughts**  It's been very long since we last coded. I have no words, other than, gotta dust myself off and get back on the wagon.

## Day 2: July 2nd, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: No coding...because I overslept

**Thoughts**  I am hopeless when I get home after work. I need to negotiate with myself how to organise my free time.

## Day 2: July 3rd, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: No progress on timer. 

**Thoughts** Turns out it's not as easy as I have initially anticipated. I'd like to figure it out myself, at the same time I know it will take WAAAAY longer if I try to. 
Maybe I'll do what I always did, stack overflow the hell out of this and get on with my life.

## Day 3-4: July 4-5th, Thursday / Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished timer. 

**Thoughts** I took the easy way out. Stack overflow. I don't have time to fap around and try to reinvent the wheel. Gotta keep going forward.

## Day 5-9: July 6-9th, Saturday / Sunday / Monday

**Today's Progress**: No work done 

**Thoughts** I went on a weekend out. I managed to fuck things up with an amazing girl. Life is good. No really, it is. I'm slaying dragons left and right.

## Day 10 - 14: July 10-14th, Tuesday...Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completely stuck

**Thoughts** I have not idea what I'm doing. The timer that I got out of stack overflow seems very simplistic, and it works, but now every time I load the page, it starts automatically.
I mean, what the actual fuck? How can element click itself automatically??? To make things worse, I can't even set up a function that updates the time on the clock. It's insanely frustrating.
I've been sitting here for over an hour, and things are worse than when I started! Anyhoo, such is the life of a the programmer I guess, so brace yourself because more buthurt is coming. 
So why I didn't program for so long? Well, I've been dating, and then crying about the fact that it's not working. That's pretty much it. No surrender! I'm back tomorrow, and the day after.
No fucks given.

## Day 15: July 15th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Figured out why the button autofired

**Thoughts** So I found the answer why the button kept firing on the load of the page. Then I started putting stuff together myself. You know what? I was fearful approaching today's session, but once I got the answer and ball going, it was fun. I need to internalise that things will go bad, and be able to deal with the frustration. Expect it, and learn how to work through it. My life, sanity, and the well being of people that i care about depends on it. Onwards, toward dragon of chaos!

## Day 16/17: July 16-17th, Wednesday / Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Got the start / pause button working

**Thoughts** Yestarday I didn't do any coding. Today, we didn't play tennis due to weather, so I actually sat down and did something. Proud of myself! Good day.

## Day 18: July 21st, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Got the minus / reset button working

**Thoughts** Ok, seriously, I am not working every day. So, either I am going to do something about it or I am accepting the fact that I want to go out with friends, and on dates, and move on with this. Think about it, if you went to college, you wouldn't allow those things to collide, yet becuase you have luxury of studying from home, you let this slide. Interesting.

## Day 19: July 22st, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished switch between clocks

**Thoughts** Tough day yesterday, I finally decided to listed to my conscious and not date two people at the same time. What's that got to do with programming you say? I've decided to apply for three different springboard courses (assuming there's not application fee). I want to do a paper, and more importantly, they provide actual placement. Even couple of months of real job experience would be invaluable.

## Day 20: July 23st, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some logic issues, researched focus method

**Thoughts** Very busy day yesterday, but all in all, I had a good time. Also managed to produce in less then 1 h new macro for work. Great result!

## Day 21: July 25st, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Had interview yesterday. Today I've finished switch between elements & focus 'logic'

**Thoughts** Still 'busy', playing tennis and drinking beers. I manage to wake up at 4.30 most of the mornings which is pretty damn impressive. I've heard that some people have to keep being\
productive and creative, otherwise they resemble zombies, and are to all intends and purposes dead if they don't. It's supposedly deeply built in their biology. I say 'they' but have myself in mind. Again, trying to feel specia? No need! I can't imagine ANY human baing that wouldn't enjoy pursuit and development. Enough rambling, im back tomorrow fixing stuff, I'm almost done with js part! Crazy.

## Day 22: July 27st, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented sound playing on timer switch. All major features are done.

**Thoughts** That's it! Pomodoro is finished. Yea, I gotta do the styling, but ... it works ! If I need to I can just push it and forget about it. Aswesome. It's amazing how one hour in the morning keeps steadily pushing you towards a goal. Yes...it's a samll goal, but still. I'll take it!
