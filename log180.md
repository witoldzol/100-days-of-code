## Day 1: July 1st, Monday

**Today's Progress**: New beginnings. Turns out we haven't coded in over a month. I'm starting new 100 day challange. Worked on pomodoro clock. 

**Thoughts**  It's been very long since we last coded. I have no words, other than, gotta dust myself off and get back on the wagon.

## Day 2: July 2nd, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: No coding...because I overslept

**Thoughts**  I am hopeless when I get home after work. I need to negotiate with myself how to organise my free time.

## Day 2: July 3rd, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: No progress on timer. 

**Thoughts** Turns out it's not as easy as I have initially anticipated. I'd like to figure it out myself, at the same time I know it will take WAAAAY longer if I try to. 
Maybe I'll do what I always did, stack overflow the hell out of this and get on with my life.

## Day 3-4: July 4-5th, Thursday / Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished timer. 

**Thoughts** I took the easy way out. Stack overflow. I don't have time to fap around and try to reinvent the wheel. Gotta keep going forward.

## Day 5-9: July 6-9th, Saturday / Sunday / Monday

**Today's Progress**: No work done 

**Thoughts** I went on a weekend out. I managed to fuck things up with an amazing girl. Life is good. No really, it is. I'm slaying dragons left and right.

## Day 10 - 14: July 10-14th, Tuesday...Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completely stuck

**Thoughts** I have not idea what I'm doing. The timer that I got out of stack overflow seems very simplistic, and it works, but now every time I load the page, it starts automatically.
I mean, what the actual fuck? How can element click itself automatically??? To make things worse, I can't even set up a function that updates the time on the clock. It's insanely frustrating.
I've been sitting here for over an hour, and things are worse than when I started! Anyhoo, such is the life of a the programmer I guess, so brace yourself because more buthurt is coming. 
So why I didn't program for so long? Well, I've been dating, and then crying about the fact that it's not working. That's pretty much it. No surrender! I'm back tomorrow, and the day after.
No fucks given.

## Day 15: July 15th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Figured out why the button autofired

**Thoughts** So I found the answer why the button kept firing on the load of the page. Then I started putting stuff together myself. You know what? I was fearful approaching today's session, but once I got the answer and ball going, it was fun. I need to internalise that things will go bad, and be able to deal with the frustration. Expect it, and learn how to work through it. My life, sanity, and the well being of people that i care about depends on it. Onwards, toward dragon of chaos!

## Day 16/17: July 16-17th, Wednesday / Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Got the start / pause button working

**Thoughts** Yestarday I didn't do any coding. Today, we didn't play tennis due to weather, so I actually sat down and did something. Proud of myself! Good day.

## Day 18: July 21st, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Got the minus / reset button working

**Thoughts** Ok, seriously, I am not working every day. So, either I am going to do something about it or I am accepting the fact that I want to go out with friends, and on dates, and move on with this. Think about it, if you went to college, you wouldn't allow those things to collide, yet becuase you have luxury of studying from home, you let this slide. Interesting.

## Day 19: July 22st, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished switch between clocks

**Thoughts** Tough day yesterday, I finally decided to listed to my conscious and not date two people at the same time. What's that got to do with programming you say? I've decided to apply for three different springboard courses (assuming there's not application fee). I want to do a paper, and more importantly, they provide actual placement. Even couple of months of real job experience would be invaluable.

## Day 20: July 23st, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some logic issues, researched focus method

**Thoughts** Very busy day yesterday, but all in all, I had a good time. Also managed to produce in less then 1 h new macro for work. Great result!

## Day 21: July 25st, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Had interview yesterday. Today I've finished switch between elements & focus 'logic'

**Thoughts** Still 'busy', playing tennis and drinking beers. I manage to wake up at 4.30 most of the mornings which is pretty damn impressive. I've heard that some people have to keep being\
productive and creative, otherwise they resemble zombies, and are to all intends and purposes dead if they don't. It's supposedly deeply built in their biology. I say 'they' but have myself in mind. Again, trying to feel specia? No need! I can't imagine ANY human baing that wouldn't enjoy pursuit and development. Enough rambling, im back tomorrow fixing stuff, I'm almost done with js part! Crazy.

## Day 22: July 27st, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented sound playing on timer switch. All major features are done.

**Thoughts** That's it! Pomodoro is finished. Yea, I gotta do the styling, but ... it works ! If I need to I can just push it and forget about it. Aswesome. It's amazing how one hour in the morning keeps steadily pushing you towards a goal. Yes...it's a samll goal, but still. I'll take it!

## Day 23: July 28st, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Styled clocks

**Thoughts** Ok, I think I have a layout in mind. I'm going back to 2 overlapping circles. We'll see how it looks when implemented. I hate styling? Well, no, it's just that I don't know what I'm doing. But I'm pretty sure it can be fun once you don't have to research every style that you want to apply. Anyway, good times.

## Day 24: July 29st, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Styled buttons

**Thoughts** I am not having a good time with the css, sigh. But hey, it's fine. It's FINE. I'll do some silly animation on start button, mess around with it. Push it, and move on with my life. IT'S FINE! :)

## Day 25: July 30st, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Making inroads into animating element

**Thoughts** I've applied yesterday for a springboard course. It's crazy sending all my degrees and transcripts from all those years...and here we go again, back to school, for the FOURTH degree. Sure buddie, you have no issues whatsoever. None... :)

## Day 26: September 1st, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 'Transition on clock / brake elements from resting state'

**Thoughts** Yesterday was a day 'out'. I woke up, felt tired as if I ran marathon previous day, switched off alarm, went back to sleep. No idea what happened, but I rolled with it instead of fighting my body. Rest of the day was slow and I let my body recoup. Today I'm back in the shape. No idea what happened, but don't matter. Also, I secured a place on online course...and realised that I do want to meet people in person, network etc, so I re-applied! Hopefully I can secure place today and have it all done. Life is looking up, going back to college...my fourth degree (this time for free!).

## Day 27: September 3st, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished pomodoro clock

**Thoughts** That's it, finished it. Is it any good? Hell no! But you know what? It doesn't matter, whatd does tho, is that I persevered and put in the work. What did I learn from all this? I learned how to transition elements via css + js. I also learned how to use the timeout functions. Good enough for me.

## Day 28: September 11th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Setting up webpack and babel

**Thoughts** I got lost in all of the settings of webpack. It is definitely a case of where I'm using waaay to many tools for the job, but then again, we do it for the sake of doing it. In other words, we are using projects as an excuse to learn new tool, even though they are overkill for the project at hand. Once I'll set up the god damn webkit, babel, and webkit server!, I'll move in on the react.js. Yes, we will be doing this one in a framework. it will b....no! I think I'll wait with react. It might be a little bit too much. Yes, let's chill and build next one in react. Also, I'm starting college this week! I will be getting my fourth degree, this time in computer...ology...hahah.

## Day 29: September 12th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Setting up webpack and babel - finished js, working on sass 

**Thoughts** It feels good to be learning new stuff again! True, I'm not writting any code but I still feel this is important to learn how to set up config files etc. I believe it will come in handy in the future. Anyway, it's also bit magical to see all that code being transpiled and compled into new files in some crazy minified format. Good times!

## Day 30: September 13th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Set up css loader for webpack 

**Thoughts** I got really discouraged while setting up webpack. Why am I doing this? What the hell? I don't need this ! But hey, we are commited, we will hack away at it until we have a working setup that automatically watches and transpiles sass and jade for me.

## Day 31: September 14th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've deleted the whole project! Starting over from the scratch with new folder structure. (simplified)

**Thoughts** I can't take it. Starting over with simplified folder structure should help. Also, repetition will help ingrain basics. Annoying? Yes, but I don't worry. I've spent like over a week trying to set up tools just so I  can start coding...I'm really starting to think this is not worth it! I mean, who cares if I know webpack, feckin babel or whatever. As long as I know how to ACTUALLY CODE it doesn't matter! Oh well, let me just do this one. I've started and I intend to finish, despite the fact that I object to the whole idea (which I came up myself in the first place!). Fresh start, follow the goddamn tutorial to the letter...it will work.

## Day 31: September 16th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started over webpack setup. Sass and css done.

**Thoughts** Ok, this time around I followed the guide to the letter, and voila, it works! Amazing, turns out I didn't need babel to complie sass at all. It's amazing, it just comples based on some silly plugin from webpack. Crazy. Also, it took me gool 3 hours...just so I don't have to type in sass -w ... seriously?! Haha, worth it!

## Day 32: September 19th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Set up webpack server

**Thoughts** School started, and with that my schedule will have to change to accomodate the fact that I'll be going to bed later (I finish classes aroung 21.30 + 40 min walk home). So that means we will have to wake up half an hour later, meaning we have less time to code. I will continue to do it, as I am very close to complete my Front Cert! I want to get it done before school gets busy! Will I be able? ONly time will tell...but I'm quite excited. School itself will be trivila for a while, given that we start at the very beginning, especially web design classes. I'm literally learning emacs while the class is running, bit silly. Anyway, I will start learning soon enough when the projects will start!

## Day 33: September 24th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Install pug loader for webpack. Setup finished!

**Thoughts** Wow, set up finished. I can actually code...lol! I decided to skip babel and react. That would be an overkill for such a project. Seriously, I just want to do the damn game and be done with it. I want that front end cert!! I need to 'hurry' because workload will increase fast with each coming week. Other than that, life is good, busy like never. Having gf doesn't help, but I won't complain...too much :_
