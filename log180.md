## Day 1: July 1st, Monday

**Today's Progress**: New beginnings. Turns out we haven't coded in over a month. I'm starting new 100 day challange. Worked on pomodoro clock. 

**Thoughts**  It's been very long since we last coded. I have no words, other than, gotta dust myself off and get back on the wagon.

**Today's Progress**: No coding...because I overslept

**Thoughts**  I am hopeless when I get home after work. I need to negotiate with myself how to organise my free time.

## Day 2: July 3rd, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: No progress on timer. 

**Thoughts** Turns out it's not as easy as I have initially anticipated. I'd like to figure it out myself, at the same time I know it will take WAAAAY longer if I try to. 
Maybe I'll do what I always did, stack overflow the hell out of this and get on with my life.

## Day 3-4: July 4-5th, Thursday / Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished timer. 

**Thoughts** I took the easy way out. Stack overflow. I don't have time to fap around and try to reinvent the wheel. Gotta keep going forward.
