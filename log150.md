## Day 151: June 13th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  I managed to add objects to directory! 

**Thoughts** It might actually work! I realise I'm making the whole vba more complicated for myself by doing it this way, but then again, this is the 'right way' to do it. Rather then exporting data to preexisting sheets and doing some simple operiation on them, I'd rather store all that data in programatically generated objects, and work on objects rather than on sheets. One thing is certain, I am learning quite a bit about vba. I still keep getting stuck on every second god damn line, because I forget some basic stuff, but screw it, I keep marching on!

## Day 152: June 14th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Sorted public variables in vba. Set up pulling data from pivot table. Reworking css in sass (FCC calculator)

**Thoughts** Today was a damn good day for programming. Everything seemed to work out without any major gripes. Awesome. I even managed to put in some time into FCC project which I've been neglecting for the past week. I want to push more time into this, given that this is my major goal. I've decided that I want to finish Front and Back certifications before the end of this year. That means we need to figure out how to put more hours into this, because wishful thinking will not suffice.

## Day 153: June 15th, Friday

**Today's Progress**:  Sorted out object properties in vba, including calculation of items to be worked. Created listeners for all keys in FCC calculator.

**Thoughts** Another good day of coding. Made progress both in vba and fcc. I really didn't feel like working on calculator, but then I thought that I pretty much have most done. There isn't much of js that needs to be written, and majority of work will be really css. That made the whole task seem bit less daunting. So I just sat down and did a bit. not much but still better than nothing. I'll take that any day. I'm still obsessing about getting a new keybord for work. To be honest, I really don't need it...and yet I want it. Don't know what to do. I konw what the smart thing is...don't buy it!

## Day 154: June 16th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  No coding today.

**Thoughts** We had glorious weather today, so I've decided to stay home...and do nothing. So be it.

## Day 155-6: June 17/8th, Sunday / Monday

**Today's Progress**:  Very minor progress. Working on looping through filtered data in vba.

**Thoughts** Still awesome weather. I've been obsessing last few days over what keyboard I should buy. I've reached a level of absurdity where I seriously were considering buying a keyboard for 330 euro! People are literally dying out of starvation, and here I am, thinking about droping a quarter of a K on a fucking keyboard. I need to do something with my life. Soon...

## Day 157: June 19th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  Good progress on FCC calculator app. Almost finished with javascript logic. 

**Thoughts** Today was a tough day at work. I got annoyed and then angry very early on as the workload was heavy and I couldn't focus, and as a result, keep up. To make things even worse, I got obsessed about getting winamp so I could watch random visualisations from it's plugin as I was listening to music. I must have spent nearly an hour trying to get that thing going. In the end I failed miserably ( can't install shit on my work computer.). Very annoying, after that I got distracted with yet another side project. This time I wanted to highlight test in TnE reports. I actually managed to do it! Problem is, it works only on Firefox, because again, I can't install third party programs. So off I went trying to implement javascript in IE using autohotkey. It almost worked, almost. Anyway, why was I angry? Real reason I guess is that my father is really sick and I don't know wheather I should go back home and visit him. I don't want to, but at the same time feel obligated...no I know it would mean a lot to him probably. To finish the day off, I managed to piss off my friend at work, and now even he won't talk to me. So be it, at least I will have more time to code while this lasts.

## Day 158: June 21th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  Getting bogged down in calculator logic (delete button complicates everything!)

**Thoughts** I've spend good few hours trying to get the damn ahk to work to no avail! I have no idea what I'm doing, which is kinda funny, given that ahk is the very first language that got me coding in the first place. I'm not going to give up, I will figure it out.

## Day 159: June 22th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Making progress with calculator logic (operators and periods)

**Thoughts** That calculator is getting bit complicated, but I'm enjoying it! It actually is fun, which makes me really happy. Today was a good day at work as well, I finally managed to get ahk to loop through document and find ALL instances of serched element. Long story short, macro is working! I was literally crushing numbers today at work! Damn, I'm loving it.

## Day 160: June 23th, Friday

**Today's Progress**:  Finished calculator 'logic'. All is working as should (no invalid inputs are allowed!)

**Thoughts** I really didn't feel like coding today, but I sat at the computer and stared at it. Somehow I clicked on the text editor, and the rest is, as they say, history. I'm going to Poland tomorrow, this will disrupt my daily flow quite significantly but I'll treat it for what it really is, test of my new habits. Fingers crossed.

## Day 161-2: June 24-5th, Saturday / Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  No coding, in Poland

**Thoughts**  I've decided to go to Poland, see my father in the hospital. It was a difficult decision for me to make. Now that I'm out of my 'safe' environment everything is faling apart. My routins are wavering. I want to stay strong and commited. I need to be able to withstand pressure and exert power in order to create working environment whenever I am. Overcome difficulties and continue on with my work. Circumstances notwithstanding.

## Day 163: July 3rd, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  Finished calculator project

**Thoughts**  It's bee over a week since last entry. Yes I know...I sounded very motivated before leaving for Poland. Yes I can, yes I will overcome...blah bla. Anyway, here we are, picking up the pieces as per usual. Few days ago I finished the vba macro, and now I am free to move on with my FreeCodeCamp. I sat today, and cranked out the god damn css for the calculator. It looks like shite, but you know what? I don't care, I'm not wasting time on css. This is not my priority. Anyway, I feel good about it, especially about that vba macro. It works like a charm, and really takes off a lot of work of my back. Love it, making staff that actually makes life easier. So cool.
