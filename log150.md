## Day 151: June 13th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  I managed to add objects to directory! 

**Thoughts** It might actually work! I realise I'm making the whole vba more complicated for myself by doing it this way, but then again, this is the 'right way' to do it. Rather then exporting data to preexisting sheets and doing some simple operiation on them, I'd rather store all that data in programatically generated objects, and work on objects rather than on sheets. One thing is certain, I am learning quite a bit about vba. I still keep getting stuck on every second god damn line, because I forget some basic stuff, but screw it, I keep marching on!
