## Day 151: June 13th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  I managed to add objects to directory! 

**Thoughts** It might actually work! I realise I'm making the whole vba more complicated for myself by doing it this way, but then again, this is the 'right way' to do it. Rather then exporting data to preexisting sheets and doing some simple operiation on them, I'd rather store all that data in programatically generated objects, and work on objects rather than on sheets. One thing is certain, I am learning quite a bit about vba. I still keep getting stuck on every second god damn line, because I forget some basic stuff, but screw it, I keep marching on!

## Day 152: June 14th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Sorted public variables in vba. Set up pulling data from pivot table. Reworking css in sass (FCC calculator)

**Thoughts** Today was a damn good day for programming. Everything seemed to work out without any major gripes. Awesome. I even managed to put in some time into FCC project which I've been neglecting for the past week. I want to push more time into this, given that this is my major goal. I've decided that I want to finish Front and Back certifications before the end of this year. That means we need to figure out how to put more hours into this, because wishful thinking will not suffice.

## Day 153: June 15th, Friday

**Today's Progress**:  Sorted out object properties in vba, including calculation of items to be worked. Created listeners for all keys in FCC calculator.

**Thoughts** Another good day of coding. Made progress both in vba and fcc. I really didn't feel like working on calculator, but then I thought that I pretty much have most done. There isn't much of js that needs to be written, and majority of work will be really css. That made the whole task seem bit less daunting. So I just sat down and did a bit. not much but still better than nothing. I'll take that any day. I'm still obsessing about getting a new keybord for work. To be honest, I really don't need it...and yet I want it. Don't know what to do. I konw what the smart thing is...don't buy it!

## Day 154: June 16th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  No coding today.

**Thoughts** We had glorious weather today, so I've decided to stay home...and do nothing. So be it.

## Day 155-6: June 17/8th, Sunday / Monday

**Today's Progress**:  Very minor progress. Working on looping through filtered data in vba.

**Thoughts** Still awesome weather. I've been obsessing last few days over what keyboard I should buy. I've reached a level of absurdity where I seriously were considering buying a keyboard for 330 euro! People are literally dying out of starvation, and here I am, thinking about droping a quarter of a K on a fucking keyboard. I need to do something with my life. Soon...

## Day 157: June 19th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  Good progress on FCC calculator app. Almost finished with javascript logic. 

**Thoughts** Today was a tough day at work. I got annoyed and then angry very early on as the workload was heavy and I couldn't focus, and as a result, keep up. To make things even worse, I got obsessed about getting winamp so I could watch random visualisations from it's plugin as I was listening to music. I must have spent nearly an hour trying to get that thing going. In the end I failed miserably ( can't install shit on my work computer.). Very annoying, after that I got distracted with yet another side project. This time I wanted to highlight test in TnE reports. I actually managed to do it! Problem is, it works only on Firefox, because again, I can't install third party programs. So off I went trying to implement javascript in IE using autohotkey. It almost worked, almost. Anyway, why was I angry? Real reason I guess is that my father is really sick and I don't know wheather I should go back home and visit him. I don't want to, but at the same time feel obligated...no I know it would mean a lot to him probably. To finish the day off, I managed to piss off my friend at work, and now even he won't talk to me. So be it, at least I will have more time to code while this lasts.

## Day 158: June 21th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  Getting bogged down in calculator logic (delete button complicates everything!)

**Thoughts** I've spend good few hours trying to get the damn ahk to work to no avail! I have no idea what I'm doing, which is kinda funny, given that ahk is the very first language that got me coding in the first place. I'm not going to give up, I will figure it out.

## Day 159: June 22th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Making progress with calculator logic (operators and periods)

**Thoughts** That calculator is getting bit complicated, but I'm enjoying it! It actually is fun, which makes me really happy. Today was a good day at work as well, I finally managed to get ahk to loop through document and find ALL instances of serched element. Long story short, macro is working! I was literally crushing numbers today at work! Damn, I'm loving it.

## Day 160: June 23th, Friday

**Today's Progress**:  Finished calculator 'logic'. All is working as should (no invalid inputs are allowed!)

**Thoughts** I really didn't feel like coding today, but I sat at the computer and stared at it. Somehow I clicked on the text editor, and the rest is, as they say, history. I'm going to Poland tomorrow, this will disrupt my daily flow quite significantly but I'll treat it for what it really is, test of my new habits. Fingers crossed.

## Day 161-2: June 24-5th, Saturday / Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  No coding, in Poland

**Thoughts**  I've decided to go to Poland, see my father in the hospital. It was a difficult decision for me to make. Now that I'm out of my 'safe' environment everything is faling apart. My routins are wavering. I want to stay strong and commited. I need to be able to withstand pressure and exert power in order to create working environment whenever I am. Overcome difficulties and continue on with my work. Circumstances notwithstanding.

## Day 163: July 3rd, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  Finished calculator project

**Thoughts**  It's bee over a week since last entry. Yes I know...I sounded very motivated before leaving for Poland. Yes I can, yes I will overcome...blah bla. Anyway, here we are, picking up the pieces as per usual. Few days ago I finished the vba macro, and now I am free to move on with my FreeCodeCamp. I sat today, and cranked out the god damn css for the calculator. It looks like shite, but you know what? I don't care, I'm not wasting time on css. This is not my priority. Anyway, I feel good about it, especially about that vba macro. It works like a charm, and really takes off a lot of work of my back. Love it, making staff that actually makes life easier. So cool.

## Day 164: July 4rd, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  Built folder structure for pomodoro project. Installed sass and bourbon.

**Thoughts**  Lazy day. I chain smoked today, no idea what the hell is up with me. I was scared to start on the new project. I know it's easy, and I'm looking forward to using new tools. I've learned how to use sass from command line. At the same time, can't escape feeling that I'm procrastinating with all those tools and gizmos. I rationalize that it's better to do that, then to watch movies or play games, so I let it be. I'm not sure what to think about the whole situation. Part of me considers coming back to Poland, to help out my family. But what good would it do? I need to keep earning money. I have more then enough time to spend on programming, so that's no excuse to run back home deluding myself that I can become software engineer all on my own sitting home doing nothing. I ready to take responsibility, just not sure if it's not too late.

## Day 165: July 5th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**: Finished setting up pug for my project.

**Thoughts**  Oh wow, I know I'm procrastinating but damn son! It took me at least 3 hours just to set up pug (jade). Damn! I tried installing it 5 times! I used npm, yarn, freaking ruby. Nothing, gets installed and poof, nothing happens. And then I found something about CLI version. What the hell is that?? Command line...something. Ohhh, well long story short, it works! I'm going full pro, and I'm doing away with Koala. No more gui's for me! Actually, those simple lessons on linux are coming in hand right now! Anyway, it might all seem like a giant waste of time, but I'm happy with myself. I definitely persevered when I really felt annoyed and frustrated with the whole pug thing. But I got it working in the end, and now I can write in glorious jade language! It's so clean, and crisp. So yea, whole day gone, zero progress on the project, but hey, I've got new shiny toy working :]
But in all fairness, I am learning command line. Little by little, its getting more natural. So what's the plan for tomorrow: - make a pomodoro mockup. I gotta know how it's going to look like before I start coding away. I know I want to keep it simple, but this time around make it not horrible as well. It will take more effort, but hey, we have bourbon! Lets use it.

## Day 166: July 6th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**: No progress

**Thoughts**  I'm sad and I don't know why. I made up my mind, I will create pomodor based on two circles, overlapping. Left / right click will add / substract minutes. One, bigger circle will relfect pomodoro timer, other the brake timer. Below I will have GO / PAUSE button. That's it. I'm drunk so I will stop here.

## Day 170: July 10th, Monday	

**Today's Progress**: No progress

**Thoughts**  Big brake, nothing done. There's always an excue to delay coding. I'm starting to wander if I ever manage to develop strong habit. I know what needs to be done. Start small, break things down. Get one thing at a time. Life keeps throwing wrenches in the spokes. Gotta stay strong.

## Day 171: July 11th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**: Installed pug and sass  on linux comp 

**Thoughts**  Ok, I definitely get better at installing pug and sass, this time it only too half and hour. Anyway, completely forgot that my linux rig is not set up. So that took time, and then I managed to do some very basic markdown, and already got stuck. Turns out I have no idea how to lay out grid, haha. Ah well, we will work on this tomorrow, I will take my time.
I was thinking that I should be grateful for every opportunity to code..I mean, I should try to imagine how life would be like witout opportunities to learn. What if I was stuck in the same job, without any perspectives, without any chances to move forward or to develop myself as a person? Think about it, we are so reach, we are spoiled for choice, opportunities. It's too much!

## Day 172: July 12th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**: Bought a new motorbike

**Thoughts**  Things to be mindful in future...take your time, examine chain more closely, how much has it been tighten! What else? No idea, bike looked perfect! I felt like I had no choice!\
2700 euro + 100 tax to put irish plates on it. Feels like a great deal. Honda hornet, 100bhp. Damn good bike. Coding? Yes! I made a new javascript macro for firefox today, it's tight. First time I used 'query selector'. No idea what it does, but it allowed me to loop through the table cells, which is amazing, and opens a whole new world of possibilites! Damn good day today! (nearly died in a car crash, but that's a minor detail.)

## Day 176: July 16th, Sunday	

**Today's Progress**: I havent done anything over the last 4 days

**Thoughts**  I'm afraid of failure, that's why I postponed declaring my goals, and deadlines to reach them. You can't win unless you risk loosing. And if you don't play you loose by deafault. I know this consciously, but it doesn't translate to action. It's not emotionally charged to propel me forward.

## Day 179: July 19th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**: Finished basic markdown in pomodoro project

**Thoughts**  I've decided to stop smoking for one day, one day at a time. I've also decided to listen to advise, and generate pressure in hope that it will motivate me into action.
Admitadely, my coding has suffered since I went over to Poland, and I haven't been able to pick it up since. I've  noticed that I've been spending a lot of time with my friend, and it's starting 
to bother me. It's too easy, and I'm fully conscious that I'm using it as a procratination tool. I will have to limit the time we get to see each other.
