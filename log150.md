## Day 151: June 13th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  I managed to add objects to directory! 

**Thoughts** It might actually work! I realise I'm making the whole vba more complicated for myself by doing it this way, but then again, this is the 'right way' to do it. Rather then exporting data to preexisting sheets and doing some simple operiation on them, I'd rather store all that data in programatically generated objects, and work on objects rather than on sheets. One thing is certain, I am learning quite a bit about vba. I still keep getting stuck on every second god damn line, because I forget some basic stuff, but screw it, I keep marching on!

## Day 152: June 14th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Sorted public variables in vba. Set up pulling data from pivot table. Reworking css in sass (FCC calculator)

**Thoughts** Today was a damn good day for programming. Everything seemed to work out without any major gripes. Awesome. I even managed to put in some time into FCC project which I've been neglecting for the past week. I want to push more time into this, given that this is my major goal. I've decided that I want to finish Front and Back certifications before the end of this year. That means we need to figure out how to put more hours into this, because wishful thinking will not suffice.
