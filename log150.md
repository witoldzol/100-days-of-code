## Day 151: June 13th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  I managed to add objects to directory! 

**Thoughts** It might actually work! I realise I'm making the whole vba more complicated for myself by doing it this way, but then again, this is the 'right way' to do it. Rather then exporting data to preexisting sheets and doing some simple operiation on them, I'd rather store all that data in programatically generated objects, and work on objects rather than on sheets. One thing is certain, I am learning quite a bit about vba. I still keep getting stuck on every second god damn line, because I forget some basic stuff, but screw it, I keep marching on!

## Day 152: June 14th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Sorted public variables in vba. Set up pulling data from pivot table. Reworking css in sass (FCC calculator)

**Thoughts** Today was a damn good day for programming. Everything seemed to work out without any major gripes. Awesome. I even managed to put in some time into FCC project which I've been neglecting for the past week. I want to push more time into this, given that this is my major goal. I've decided that I want to finish Front and Back certifications before the end of this year. That means we need to figure out how to put more hours into this, because wishful thinking will not suffice.

## Day 153: June 15th, Friday

**Today's Progress**:  Sorted out object properties in vba, including calculation of items to be worked. Created listeners for all keys in FCC calculator.

**Thoughts** Another good day of coding. Made progress both in vba and fcc. I really didn't feel like working on calculator, but then I thought that I pretty much have most done. There isn't much of js that needs to be written, and majority of work will be really css. That made the whole task seem bit less daunting. So I just sat down and did a bit. not much but still better than nothing. I'll take that any day. I'm still obsessing about getting a new keybord for work. To be honest, I really don't need it...and yet I want it. Don't know what to do. I konw what the smart thing is...don't buy it!

## Day 154: June 16th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  No coding today.

**Thoughts** We had glorious weather today, so I've decided to stay home...and do nothing. So be it.
