# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -1: January 1st, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use Git, and command line. 

**Thoughts:** Not sure what project to start on. Maybe I'll work on freeCodeCamp projects?

### Day 0: January 2nd, 2017, Monday


**Today's Progress**: Decided to continue with basic JavaScript tutorial on freeCodeCamp, and tackle miniproject.

**Thoughts**: Usning loops and if statements together turned out to be quite tricky. Finally I figured out that loops wouldnt keep iterating  if I had two 'if' statements in one loop.

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm challenges.

**Thoughts** Figuring out algorithms is great fun. It really forces me to flex my brain and makes me practice what I've learned so far.

### Day 2: January 4th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm challenges.

**Thoughts** Great fun, I'm feeling confident when solving those puzzles. They've set the difficulity to reasonable level.

### Day 3: January 5th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed 3 algorithms: 'Find the longest word in a string', 'capitalize first letter of every word', and 'return largest number from array/subarray'

**Thoughts** Beginning was tough, I couldn't figure out how loops work, but I kept at it. I finished evening with great sense of satisfaction once things made sense, and code worked.

### Day 4: January 6th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed another two algorithm 'puzzles'

**Thoughts** Couldn't wait to get back to algorithms! Very happy with the fact how much I'm enjoying solving puzzles. Since it's Friday, I'm conding only for an hour.

### Day 5: January 7th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed another three algorithm 'puzzles'

**Thoughts** I had fun today. At the end of fourth hour I got tired of it though. Theres so much information to take in at onece, that it quickly becomes overwhelming. Anyway, good day of work. I'm happy.

### Day 6: January 8th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed another two algorithm 'puzzles'

**Thoughts** Feeling very lazy today, no energy whatsoever. The good thing is that I decided to work on code at a set time each day. It helps with motivation, because when the clock rings, I gotta sit in front of computer and start hacking. No excuses. Progress was slow, but I ended up enjoying myself. It takes time to understand things properly, and I don't pressure myself to get things done as fast as possible. I take my time to really figure out what is it that I'm doing and how to best solve problems at hand. I ended up learning really cool stuf, and I finish my day feeling good about the whole process. Good times

### Day 7: January 9th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed basic Algorithms exercises on FCC

**Thoughts** Didn't really feel like coding today. Again, 6pm I was in front of computer. I had last algo to do, and was keen to figure it out. I have to admit, it was really fun getting it done step by step, seeing results materialize in front of my eyes.

### Day 8: January 10th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed tutorial on JSON and AJAX. Installed Brackets, and played around with it. Set up files for new project. 

**Thoughts** Didn't code much today, tutorial was very passive, and didn't explain much. It's time to do projects on my own, and figure stuff out while I go along. No more hand holding it seems. Excited!

### Day 9: January 11th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Very little progress today. I've tried to set up Brackets editor with PrePros. The idea was to write code in jade/sass, have it processed by PrePros, and have Brackets autoupdate linked website. Alas, that didn't work out the way I hoped. Prepros did it's job, but Brackets just wouldn't notice that html changed. So back to square 1. Gonna work with vanilla html and css (smart idea come to think of it.)

**Thoughts** I'm bit annoyed at myself that I'm not doing any actual coding. This is second day where I faf around setting things up and playing with tools, instead of learning how to actually code. Oh well, I guess I have to get this out of my system, get over new toys and move along.

### Day 10: January 12th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've started over 1h late today. I did very little, managed to pull JSON file from server, using API. So that's awesome, but code wise I learned very little. 

**Thoughts** I feel I have no idea what to do when working on this project. I haven't done any exercises that would solidify very short overview of JSON /AJAX/ API. So I'm on my own! Progress is very slow, and it's frustrating. I have to take that on board and start with very simple, and basic functionalities. Repetition is the key. Looking forward to tomorrow.
