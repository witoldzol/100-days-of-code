# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -1: January 1st, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use Git, and command line. 

**Thoughts:** Not sure what project to start on. Maybe I'll work on freeCodeCamp projects?

### Day 0: January 2nd, 2017, Monday


**Today's Progress**: Decided to continue with basic JavaScript tutorial on freeCodeCamp, and tackle miniproject.

**Thoughts**: Usning loops and if statements together turned out to be quite tricky. Finally I figured out that loops wouldnt keep iterating  if I had two 'if' statements in one loop.

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm challenges.

**Thoughts** Figuring out algorithms is great fun. It really forces me to flex my brain and makes me practice what I've learned so far.

### Day 2: January 4th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm challenges.

**Thoughts** Great fun, I'm feeling confident when solving those puzzles. They've set the difficulity to reasonable level.

### Day 3: January 5th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed 3 algorithms: 'Find the longest word in a string', 'capitalize first letter of every word', and 'return largest number from array/subarray'

**Thoughts** Beginning was tough, I couldn't figure out how loops work, but I kept at it. I finished evening with great sense of satisfaction once things made sense, and code worked.

### Day 4: January 6th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed another two algorithm 'puzzles'

**Thoughts** Couldn't wait to get back to algorithms! Very happy with the fact how much I'm enjoying solving puzzles. Since it's Friday, I'm conding only for an hour.

### Day 5: January 7th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed another three algorithm 'puzzles'

**Thoughts** I had fun today. At the end of fourth hour I got tired of it though. Theres so much information to take in at onece, that it quickly becomes overwhelming. Anyway, good day of work. I'm happy.

### Day 6: January 8th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed another two algorithm 'puzzles'

**Thoughts** Feeling very lazy today, no energy whatsoever. The good thing is that I decided to work on code at a set time each day. It helps with motivation, because when the clock rings, I gotta sit in front of computer and start hacking. No excuses. Progress was slow, but I ended up enjoying myself. It takes time to understand things properly, and I don't pressure myself to get things done as fast as possible. I take my time to really figure out what is it that I'm doing and how to best solve problems at hand. I ended up learning really cool stuf, and I finish my day feeling good about the whole process. Good times

### Day 7: January 9th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed basic Algorithms exercises on FCC

**Thoughts** Didn't really feel like coding today. Again, 6pm I was in front of computer. I had last algo to do, and was keen to figure it out. I have to admit, it was really fun getting it done step by step, seeing results materialize in front of my eyes.

### Day 8: January 10th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed tutorial on JSON and AJAX. Installed Brackets, and played around with it. Set up files for new project. 

**Thoughts** Didn't code much today, tutorial was very passive, and didn't explain much. It's time to do projects on my own, and figure stuff out while I go along. No more hand holding it seems. Excited!

### Day 9: January 11th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Very little progress today. I've tried to set up Brackets editor with PrePros. The idea was to write code in jade/sass, have it processed by PrePros, and have Brackets autoupdate linked website. Alas, that didn't work out the way I hoped. Prepros did it's job, but Brackets just wouldn't notice that html changed. So back to square 1. Gonna work with vanilla html and css (smart idea come to think of it.)

**Thoughts** I'm bit annoyed at myself that I'm not doing any actual coding. This is second day where I faf around setting things up and playing with tools, instead of learning how to actually code. Oh well, I guess I have to get this out of my system, get over new toys and move along.

### Day 10: January 12th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've started over 1h late today. I did very little, managed to pull JSON file from server, using API. So that's awesome, but code wise I learned very little. 

**Thoughts** I feel I have no idea what to do when working on this project. I haven't done any exercises that would solidify very short overview of JSON /AJAX/ API. So I'm on my own! Progress is very slow, and it's frustrating. I have to take that on board and start with very simple, and basic functionalities. Repetition is the key. Looking forward to tomorrow.

### Day 11: January 13th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished 'Random Quote Machine'. 

**Thoughts** I feel wretched. I've spent well over 2 hours finetuning 20 lines of code. I feel like I havent learned anything. I still don't understand anything about jQuery, nor for that matter API's or javascript itself. Oh well, gotta march on. Bit by bit, it will all unravel eventually.

### Day 12: January 14th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Really finished Random Quote Machine! I Improved css, added twitter button, and implemented random background color transition when button is pressed. 

**Thoughts** I was apprehensive approaching project after yesterday. But the first thing that I've done upon waking up, was getting my laptom and researching javascript. I needed to get it done. Coding is on my mind all the time now, and I'm loving it. Seeing smooth transitions between colors made my day. So simple, yet so awesome!!!

### Day 13: January 14th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:I've done research on Ajax, API's, and Sublime editor. I've signed for google and openWeather Api's, written markup for weatherApp, created pen, and finally, I've listened to my housemate bitch about his life, and then I made him to finally fix his goddamn bicycle tyre. 

**Thoughts** It was going to be a productive day, but reality struck hard, and I ended up smoking rollies with friends, cooking dinner, watching movie I didn't really enjoyed(La La Land- it's great, I just hate musicals in general), and finally, chatting with housemates about life, philosophy, and how  they are misguided creatures that need to amend their ways. I didn't get much done, but I'm still happy. Today was a good day.

### Day 14: January 15th, Monday

**Today's Progress**:I've managed to  hook up google's and onlineweather's api's and display data from json. I've also managed to display a picture corresponding to current weather conditions. Now I'm trying to figure out how to get working a toggle button to display temperature in either celcius or farhen...heit? degrees. 

**Thoughts** I'm having a blast. I kinda know what to do, but at the same time I keep learning bit by bit.  Not feeling overwhelmed. I'm in a good place.

### Day 15: January 16th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:I've got literraly nothing done. 

**Thoughts** I can't make jQuery work, or is fault in html? Who knows! I can't get that fucking button do a siple on/off. I'm extremely frustraded, and angry. I've tried doing some codewars cata's earlier on today. That was a mistake, because it made me realise how little I know, and how much I've already forgotten things that I thought I knew how to do. Extremely demorolising experience. I'm going to call it a night, not getting anything done, just getting more a more angry at myself.

### Day 16: January 17th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I got the button working. In one minute. Like...seriously?! Overall, I finished the weather app. 

**Thoughts** Couldn't believe that button would just work. I was using wrong jQuery call (click, instead of .on("click")). Anyway, I didn't feel like coding today, really felt apprehensive about yesterday's experience. But I made myself to sit in front of computer, and the rest, is a history...

### Day 17: January 18th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Got done very little. Set up project files, looked at wiki api rules. 

**Thoughts** I'm falling off the wagon. I break my own rules. Wiki project feels overwhelming. I have to break it up. Wrap my head around it. Take my time to learn and understand how things work. So far it feels as if I copy pasted all the code. I have no idea what I'm doing. But that's ok, lets get things working, and figure out why later.

### Day 18: January 19th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Done a bit of research on wiki API, didn't learn anything. Wow. 

**Thoughts** Again feeling lazy, the scale of the problem feels overwhelming. No idea how to start. Can't even get the API to work. Gonna take a step back today. I feel tired.

### Day 19: January 20th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Changed markup, got closer to figuring out api settings. 

**Thoughts** I'm feeling very down. No motivation to work on code whatsoever. It's like all my energy completely fizzled out. Suddenly coding might not be something that I want to pursue. It's amazing how quickly things can change in my head. Anyway, it was to be expected, thatj's why I'm working on developing routine that will keep me going even if I don't feel like it. I'm making very little progress at the moment but I will find a way out, and pick up a pace. I decided that getting thing to work is more important that trying to understand what is it that I'm doing. So, ill ship first and hope that one day I will get it. No worries.
