# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use Git, and command line. 

**Thoughts:** Not sure what project to start on. Maybe I'll work on freeCodeCamp projects?

### Day 0: January 2nd, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Decided to continue with basic JavaScript tutorial on freeCodeCamp, and tackle miniproject.

**Thoughts**: Usning loops and if statements together turned out to be quite tricky. Finally I figured out that loops wouldnt keep iterating  if I had two 'if' statements in one loop.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
