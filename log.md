# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -1: January 1st, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use Git, and command line. 

**Thoughts:** Not sure what project to start on. Maybe I'll work on freeCodeCamp projects?

### Day 0: January 2nd, 2017, Monday


**Today's Progress**: Decided to continue with basic JavaScript tutorial on freeCodeCamp, and tackle miniproject.

**Thoughts**: Usning loops and if statements together turned out to be quite tricky. Finally I figured out that loops wouldnt keep iterating  if I had two 'if' statements in one loop.

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm challenges.

**Thoughts** Figuring out algorithms is great fun. It really forces me to flex my brain and makes me practice what I've learned so far.

### Day 2: January 4th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm challenges.

**Thoughts** Great fun, I'm feeling confident when solving those puzzles. They've set the difficulity to reasonable level.

### Day 3: January 5th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed 3 algorithms: 'Find the longest word in a string', 'capitalize first letter of every word', and 'return largest number from array/subarray'

**Thoughts** Beginning was tough, I couldn't figure out how loops work, but I kept at it. I finished evening with great sense of satisfaction once things made sense, and code worked.

### Day 4: January 6th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed another two algorithm 'puzzles'

**Thoughts** Couldn't wait to get back to algorithms! Very happy with the fact how much I'm enjoying solving puzzles. Since it's Friday, I'm conding only for an hour.

### Day 5: January 7th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed another three algorithm 'puzzles'

**Thoughts** I had fun today. At the end of fourth hour I got tired of it though. Theres so much information to take in at onece, that it quickly becomes overwhelming. Anyway, good day of work. I'm happy.
