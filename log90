### Day 91: April 3rd, Monday	

**Today's Progress**:  Good progress on 4th advanced macro. Further polished ahk macro and finished whoswho macro (ahk).

**Thoughts** Overall, decent day. It's good to get back to javascript. That moment when I realised how I can iterate through that array while accounting for various different variables...awesome! I would never thoguth of that! Ha.

### Day 92: April 4th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished 4th advanced algorithm!

**Thoughts** Wooooohooo! That was intense! Damn, I'm actually proud of this one. Seriously, when I started out I had no idea how am I going to tackle this one, but as I went further and further, things aligned of their own accord. It's amazing, you write stuff, realize new stuff, write some more, and before you know it, you are done! Damn! Hahaha. I went to my very first coding meetup. There must have been over 60 pepz over there. I didn't speak to anyone, of course, because issues. Nevertheless, I'm happy that I went. I will keep at it, just like I do with the code, until something will give. (but surely, writing code seems easier at times than talking to people you don't know).

### Day 93: April 5th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished 5th advanced algorithm!

**Thoughts** 5th algo was very anti climatic. Super easy. No idea why the difficulity is so wildly different. I understand that for some folks different stuff might be easier / harder. But there is some objective measure i how difficult algo is, and this one, was trivial.
Oh well, no fear, no. 6 is pretty painful. Or trivial again. It's math based, all I have to figure out is the math behind it (assuming there is one...)

### Day 94: April 6th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**:  6th algo is either tough math or recursive function (which I don't get yet)

**Thoughts** I'm tired

**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

### Day 95: April 7th, Friday	

**Today's Progress**:  Stack overflow has priovided answer (actually two ansewers)

**Thoughts** I battle with myself. Should I use stack's answer? Will I learn this way? Maybe I will learn more if I just take it, understand how it works and move on with my life? As opposed to striving to reinvent wheel myself every time. It just doesn't make sense to me to waste time, reading around subject ... if I can just take the answer, analyze it and implement it. I'm going forward, I release fantasy of being an alpha and omega. I will take resources available and use them. Gotta keep moving to stay alive.

### Day 96: April 8th, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**:  Trying to figure out permutation algo

**Thoughts** Taking it easy. Saturday. Playing board games...and winning. Good times.

### Day 99: April 11th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Researching recursive functions

**Thoughts** No progress. Dark thoughts. Havent updated log or made commit in 3 days now.

**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

### Day 100: April 12th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Researching recursive functions

**Thoughts** Still no progress. This is big. It's next level. It's like learning nested arrays for the first time again. It hurts. I think I get it now. But I still don't know how to apply / implement. Also, there is a 'way' of designing those functions, so they don't break and eventually do what you want them to do. So, now I gotta learn how to design them without exploding my head. Needless to say, I am having an aweful time. No motivation, no enthusiasm, no energy. Just wanna curl up in a bed and sleep forever. Minute things annoy me, people annoy me. I annoy myself. I know so much, I learned so many techniques...and yet I let my morale go down. I've been working on this coding habit for the past 3 months...and suddenly I feel like it made no difference...no, thats not true. I can't imagine not coding at this point. I might have a few days of slack, but theres no way in hell I'm taking a long term break. I need to remind myself why I do whatever it is that I do. I gotta stay vigilant, and listen to dark whispers in my head, and torpedoe them instantly they appear. I will persevere! Also, today is day 100! (which I realised only today, after 4 days of break - good timing for sure to get back.)

### Day 101: April 13th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**:  Still researching recursive function. Improved allocation (vba) macro by adding filtering functionality.

**Thoughts** Minor progress with recursion. I got a little bit more practice in. It's starting to make more sense. Now I need to figure out the permutations and their implementation within recursion that includes loop iteration. Mind blown. But I'll get there. I just gotta make the whole abstract thing more tangible, by simply hammering code over and over again, until it becomes something real (if that makes sense).
I've came to a realisation today how deeply paralytic has been my fear of uncertainty over the course of my life. I keep delaying my life, keep postponing until 'this or that'...or until 'im ready' etc. It's been like this since I can remember. These days, over the last few weeks I experenced very vividly stress that came directly from uncertain future. Where will I go, what will I do? But when I thought about it, it made no sense to worry. I've been in new situations many times prior, and I've always managed to, not only survive, but to thrive, at times. Every job I started, I had a blast! I should be looking forward to a change of circumstances, rather than fear them! Regarding my holidays. I really wanted to cancel yesterday, I was feeling down and I just wanted it to be over. But I had a kindling feeling, that I shouldning be making decisions when being emotionally biased. So I didn't. I listened that that faint meek voice at the back of my head. Today, I asked myself...'whats easier, to cancel holiday or to make a plane and execute it as cheap and awesome as possible?'. What woudld Bruce Lee do? He would have gone with the 'difficult' option! I gotta stop running away from problems, stop giving in to phantom fear in my head, because if I continue to do so, it will define my whole life. Baby steps, we start with holiday, we finish with whole new life on a new continent. Fuck it, YOLO!

### Day 102/3: April 14th / 15th, Friday / Saturday	

**Today's Progress**:  No progress on recursion.

**Thoughts** I can't shake a thought that I could be doing so much more. That I waste so much time, that I'm so behind....it makes no god damn sense! Behind what? I wasted years and years just sitting in front of my computer playing games. Now? At least I'm doing something, I'm building towards a rewarding future. (not that it matters, the actual reward is having a goal and working towards it). I still find myself thinking about her. What if's cruising throught my head. I am reminded of her, every time I pass a place we went to together. I never gave her any thought when I was with her. Now that shes gone, she's on my mind. We truly cannot desire what we have. 
I thought that it might be a good idea to surface my fears. At least once a day I think about future, and immediatelly get caught in grips of fear. So maybe I should write them up? Give them a physical form, and myself, a chance to dismantle them. So, ill write every day fear a day.
Today, on my way to the shop, I thought about living in Vietnam, making websites for a living. Immediately, thought came through my mind 'YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO, HOW TO MAKE PROFESSIONAL WEBSITES, YOU WONT MAKE IT....ITS TOO DIFFICULT, THE SECURITY, PROFESSIONAL DESIGN AND UX...YOU DONT KNOW ENOUGH...YOU CAN'T DO IT'.
First of all, I don't have to go anywhere. And when I do, I don't have to make a living. I have lots of savings, enough to last me years without lifting a finger. Second of all, even if I took an assignment to make a website, I can do an easy one. Follow tutorials, stack overflow all the necessary stuff, and ship it. And if it will be crappy, so what? I'll be making it for crappy money anyway. Most of the stuff is modular and have been written anyway. You won't be making anything ambitious for your first projects. And if other people can do it, so can you. Easy peasy. Just time and practice. Just like with nested arrays...I didn't get those at all, my brain hurt justy trying to think about those. And now? It's so obvious, and easy! I get it. I will be ok, wherever I'll go. Worst case scenario I can always get a job as an engish teacher. Best case secnario. I'll live my life.

### Day 104: April 16th, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished week 3 of Learn how to learn course.

**Thoughts**  Still stuck on that god damn alogrithm. I don't understand how the recursion triggers iteration of the loop inside of it. I guess, it runs it's course, finally returns value?... maybe...and...ahhh.. I have no idea what I'm doing. Good times, learning slowely but surely. I want to get some practice with simple recursions, play around with things, loops ... see how all the elements fit together. Am I obsessing too much about it? Well, I want to learn, not just push the challange for the sake of unlocking it. It's an important bit I fell so I will be patient with myself. Also, I want to implement 'to do' list (again). Not sure what is the best wayt to go about it. Should I write it down, or use computer. Hmm. It's easier to type it out, but than again, its easier to look it up on the paper....paper it is!

### Day 105: April 17th, Sunday	

**Today's Progress**:  Day off from coding. 

**Thoughts**  I collected my motorbike from the mechanic today, played tennis, made dinner and laundry. All in all, today was a good day. I didn't do any coding, but I've decided not to feel bad about it. I will put in some work tomorrow, at work. Plan is to meet daily quota before lunch, and focus on my stuff for the rest of the day. I've seen a presentation given by some young guy. He talked about creating things, and how to execute them. He brought to attention how amazing times we live in are. We have so many options, public and instantly accessible knowledge about anything we desire to learn. Truly 'magical' times. Yes. I keep thinking about Bou, that guy who has a family, two small kids, full time job, how did 3 year degree in half a year, and than a bunch of other courses in record time. And now he is making a ton of guide videos on javascript. How does he do it? This confidence, and power of commitment eludes me. I wish I could be like that...and I know I can. I also know that I create in my mind an invisible wall, and keep telling myslf that I can't cross it, that certain things are impossible for me. I cognitively know that I can, yet I am aware of my own, self imposed, limitations. How do I dimantle them? Confidence!
I remember watching a guy give a speech on how to pick up women. All I remember from this, is that lack of confidence comes from lack of knowledge. Its so obvious, yet not intuitive (to me at least). Long story short, if you know what you doing, you will be confident. Same with coding, working as a freelancer etc. All I gotta do is to learn what to do, and I will be able to push my limits. But wait...isn't overcoming limitation all about moving outside of comfort zone, and doing things without actually knowing / havign confidence? So to speak, taking a dive into a deep water? Well, maybe. But I don't care, there is only one person to judge me, and that is myself. I won't do anything without confidence, hence all I care about is gettin some, and not adhering to some imaginary 'you should be this or that'. Good enough for me.

### Day 106: April 18th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**:  No progress. Again. 

**Thoughts**  I'm dejected at this stage. I'm looking at the same solution for two weeks now and still don't understand nor can replicate it. Is it too much? Am I missing some fundamental understanding underlying this algo? You know what? I don't care, I will keep going back until it will make fucking sense. I don't care if this is efficient, I don't care if I could work harder or whatever the fuck I keep telling myslef. I will just sit in front of my computer every fucking day and stare at the solution until it makes sense.

### Day 107: April 19th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Didn't code today

**Thoughts**  No major feelings, just ended up watching breaking bad S1. Wow, its a really good show. Busy at work as well. My best friend lost his father yesterday.

### Day 108: April 20th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on vba macro

**Thoughts**  No motivation.


**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

### Day 109: April 21th, Friday	

**Today's Progress**:  More progress on vba macro

**Thoughts**  I'm floating. Three months of coding every day, and it all fizzled out. So much for a habit.


**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

### Day 110: April 22th, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**:  Day off from coding

**Thoughts**  No motivation. Stuck and dejected. It's very hard to go back and keep up fighting. It's like I've burned through my alloted resources and now I'm just lying to myself. I have no power, now will, no motivation, no goal, no nothing.

### Day 111: April 23th, Sunday	

**Today's Progress**:  Looking at heap's algorithm as a solution to permutation problem.

**Thoughts**  I'm in the dumps. I really am, and I have no willpower to change it. I'm rewatching Breaking Bad, and I keep thinking why Jessie keeps doing stupid things. I'm all like...dude stop being an idiot, pull it together! Just do the smart thing. Why can't I do the smart thing in my actual, real life? I'm afraid. Every time I'm thinking about trying to make it as a developer on my own, out there in big scary world. It's terrifying. I said previously that I want to make a list of things that scare me, so I can analyse and debunk them. Tomorrow is as a good day as any. 


**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

### Day 112: April 24th, Monday	

**Today's Progress**:  I've analysed heap's algorithm. I kinda understand what it does.

**Thoughts**  I'm fighting back. I want to get back to observign 6pm religiously. There's no freedom without discipline. 


**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

### Day 113: April 25th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Rewriting Heap's algorithm, trying to understant it mechanically. Worked on vba macro.

**Thoughts**  I'm focusing on process not on 'product'. Whenver you think about doing something challenging, you feel anxiety, bad vibes etc...turns out that thinking about hard stuff activates pain receptors in your brain. No wander procrastinatin was my beloved lady for so many years. All I gotta do is focus on task at hand, without thinking about what is it  that I'm trying to do. So just think 'im sitting in front of computer and type out stuff'. Whenever a thought comes across about the goal, or end product all you gotta do is go 'LALALALALALAALALALA i can't hear you...'. So yea. There you go, procrastination solved. I'm not sure to what degree I'm being sarcastic now. I'd say I'm 50 / 50 on this one. But I do know one thing... it works. All I gotta do now, is use this tool. Simples, right?


**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

### Day 114: April 26th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Written Heap's algorithm on my own. That's it! I'm shipping it. 

**Thoughts**  I'm not going to pretend that I understand this algo. I feel dirty doing this, but I have to keep in mind the bigger picture. And the picture aint pretty. I'm clamming up trying to understand something that is bit too far from the scaffolding. It's very inefficient. Maybe situations like that are highly motivational for others, but not for me. I just don't get shit done, procrastinate and ultimately start going backwards instead of forward. The important lesson from all this is that I get how recursion works in theory, and I can implement very simple case of it. That's good enough for me. Something is telling me I will revisit this subject in future, and by then I hope to have more knowledge and experience to deal with it. Right now, I gotta get back on track, feel the wind in my hair :). It's been over two weeks, and submiting this algo feels very anthiclimatic, but fuck it. This is real life, not a movie. Keep on trucking!

### Day 115: April 27th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**:  Started on 7th algo (constructors and classes)

**Thoughts**  There's a lot to learn about objects and constructors. I see tons of practice, vids, little excercises ahead of me. So I won't do it. Fuck it, holidays are up, I need it. Excuse? Maybe, don't care. I need a reset. After 100 day challange, I deserve to let loose and change background. Get fresh perspective, maybe reflect on my near future. I'm looking forward to it. I konw its a pain to organise, and to do it all alone, but the same time, I want to enjoy it. There's no one to judge me, just me and my own way of traveling. I can do whatever I want, however I want. Sounds lonely and sad, but it aint. It's liberating. 


**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

### Day 116: April 28th, Friday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished 8th algo

**Thoughts**  I'm going to Italy tomorrow. I'm nervous, I haven't prepared or planned any plan. I just know what cities / places I'll visit, but I have no clue what to do once I get there, but ... hey, screw it. It'm not going to min max my holidays. I'll take it easy, and just walk around. That's it. I don't have to do anything exciting or amazing. Just kick back and do what I like: walk around.


**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

### Day 117: May 11th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**:  I'm back from holidays. Finished 2 more algos

**Thoughts**  Italy went well. I injured my knee, which resulted in rather painful sighseeing, but other than that I managed well. There were no hickups with hostels or transport. Weather was brilliant for the most part. I figured out situation with food as well. I also talked with Hye Kyung. The fact that she was so close lured me into chatting her up. I finally asked why she broke up. Said she didn't want long distance relationship. I thanked her and called it a day. Made no sense, to plan this trip with me to change her mind 180 degrees a month later. I don't want to really know I guess. I got my closure of sorts, this will suffice. Once she was gone from Italy, it really hit me that its over between us. For real. Weird feeling, also quite painful. Anyway, I'm back and of course I struggle to get back into rutine. I'm taking my time. Easy does it.

### Day 118-20: May 12-14th, Friday - Sunday	

**Today's Progress**:  No work done. 

**Thoughts**  I completely lost my rythm. I don't work out. I don't code. I want to (again) establish rigid time schedule for coding. It's vital for building a strong habit and routine. Also, I wan't to stick to wake up time ie. no late mornings in bed on weekends. Get out and get busy. Life is passing by. Ambitious, but realistic. I can do this. 


**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

### Day 121: May 15th, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  I've worked on vba macro - additional deletions.

**Thoughts**  I want to spend less time working at work and focus on developing macro in vba. It's very important and can save a ton of time for us. Also, if I manage to implement it and get it pass official approval, it's something that I can put on my 'cv'. Clear goal ahead, gotta push! I feel very lazy, it's difficult to get up and get going. I want to change that, I want to realise my potential. I don't want to live in fear for the rest of my life. 


**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

### Day 122: May 16th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  Vba macro: export file to new workbook and close open workbooks.

**Thoughts**  I've spent all afternoon and evening at the grill party. Good times. Coded for an hour at work.  


**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

### Day 123: May 17th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  No coding today. Busy at work.

**Thoughts**  I was late for work so I had to crank it up. Also gotta do some extra stuff so busy busy. I'm thinking about solution for TnE department which would require webscraping or something of that sort. I'd like to scrape all images and displayed them in a gui as thumbnails or something like that. That would be pretty damn sweet. Keep on dreaming...  


**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

### Day 124: May 18th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Again, no coding.

**Thoughts**  I lost control of myself. Whenever I come back home...it's over. There is huge resistance to doing anything. All I want to do is lie down in my bed and watch youtube mindlessly. Not sure how to break this. I guess I need a ...what you call it, a pattern. I could make dinner, prepare everything...and then take a shower...that would be a good que. Study every day after shower. That might work.  


**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

### Day 125: May 19th, Friday

**Today's Progress**:  No code.

**Thoughts**  Left work early. Made some dinner, went over for a grill. And that was the whole day. Nothing achieved, because I don't want to say no to Bart. But he doesn't need me to be there. I don't have to stay all the way. I can always get out early and grab an hour or two of coding. Or even better, I can plan ahead, get code in early and have the rest of the day for myself. Sounds good on paper. Now, I gotta apply. Start slow, take small victories, no need to get discourage early. Be mindful, and keep at it. Bit ty bit, towards a realisation of potential.

### Day 126: May 20th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  Working on vlookup in vba.

**Thoughts**  I woke up at 5am. My new routine, I hope. I'll study italian, vietnamese, and if i fell like it, spanish. Wow right? And I do know not to overburden myself, to go easy at the start! I read the research, I know the facts, and yet, here we are. 3 languages at one time. How do I justify it? Well, I don't want to learn, learn, languages. For example, I'd be happy if I learn vietnamese to the level of my current italian. Where's the bathroom, no meat please, etc. No pressure. I don't intend to learn the whole thing, that's crazy, this language is the weirdest thing ever. Random letters in random order, there is literally no point of reference whatsoever. But again, days go by. One by one, and they turn into months and years. I just want to chip away silently at these languages, so one day I would wake up and realise that I can communicate in these languages should need occur. It feels like 'languages for free', in other words, I don't want to put any effort into this. No 'power drilling, no minmaxing'. That would require too much energy, too much motivation....it would reaquire a WHY that resonates with my core values, and that is not the case when it comes to learning languages. It's just something that sounds 'cool to do/know'. 


**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

### Day 127: May 21th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  Looked at code...literally.

**Thoughts**  I refuse to feel bad about procrastination. Feeling bad will not help, quite the contrary. It will only slow me down. I know it feels like we are not moving forward, heck, feels like we are going backwards. That's normal, and it's part of the process. What process? Process of becoming. Why am I obsessed with becoming 'better' and getting more? I have so much. Why can't I just be satisfied with who I am, who I became already? My goals...desires havent changed, but the motives underlying them did. I did use to feel insufficient, very imperfect. I wanted to be perfect, made whole....I realize how dangerous fantasy that is. I will not deny that I've entertained it for years. So what changed? Have I trancended my suffering, my self critique? Yes, do a degree. I'm ok with 'good enough' these days. Also, I try to become, because I pursue the process not the end goal. Freedom comes dyscipline, and I've always desired it. Whether I realised it or not.

### Day 128: May 22th, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  Researched vlookup for vba

**Thoughts**  I'm finding it hard to hack vlookup between multiple workbooks in vba. The fact that I have no idea what I'm doing is not helping! I resist sitting down and patiently going learning basics in order to abstract to higher level of complexity. I just want to quickly hack (copy paste) a bunch of lines of code that will get shit done and forget about it. So I'm at the crossroads. Also, I am putting everything into one subroutine...which I'm guessing is pretty horrible practice. I mean, spaghetti code is real. I'll just leave it as is and start new sub that will handle vlookup. I am not working on freecodecamp. Havent looked at the ... LAST ... algo in ages. All I gotta do is wrap it up and move on to projects, and that's it! But noooooo...here I am hacking some vba macro God knows what the fuck for. Ah well. Happy birthday to myself! I hit 35 years today, my solemn decision is to quit smokes, for real. I've spent last 17 years smoking. I owe it to myself to be done with it. I will do as I decided. No excuses.

**Link(s) to work**: [https://github.com/witoldzol/advancedAlgos][]

### Day 129: May 23th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on 10th advanced algo 

**Thoughts**  Busy day, both at work and after. I woke up at 5am, did my language lessons. Got up, did kettlebells, ate breakfast, packed. I pushed production at work, finished extra assignments, helped other team...jeeezaz, even found time to attent horrible meeting about lgbt and inclusivness and all that garbage. After work I must have spent 3 hours at Marcins place fighting with his goddamn computer which simply refuses to work. Well we made progress, it turns on and stuff showes up on screen so I guess its something. Anyhow, turned out we didn't need to buy new psu. So I ended up with his old power supply, which means I've got a computer again. Like a real computer. Linux baby! Wow, long day. While I was eating my supper, I reflected on passed day, and thought to myself...holy shit we did a lot. Like...I remember myself from back in a day, and the difference in energy and 'motivation' and very visible. Hope. (My ex texted me birthday wishes, I do miss her..)

### Day 130: May 24th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  Finished subroutine in vba macro

**Thoughts**  Good progress on vba macro. I've closed off another subroutine and managed to export file path while saving the file. Pretty awesome, very happy with that. It's smooth and unobtrusive. Tomorrow I'm moving to vlookup and allocating names. I've left a meeting with my bosses boss. Boring af, words cannot describe how pointless and wastful those meetings are with execs / higher managers.

### Day 131: May 25th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Vba: basic vlookup finished

**Thoughts**  Things are taking time. We played tennis today, we sucked hard. Weather was amazing though. I'm not getting enough sleep I think. I'm not tired...but I have a feeling I need more sleep. I have been waking up earlier, but I keep going to bed at the usual time, which results in serious sleep deficiency (comperatively). Ah well, we are testing things out. Lets not jump to conclusions.

### Day 132-3: May 26-7th, Friday and Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  No coding done. 

**Thoughts**  I drank quite a bit of alcohol over the past two days. I was too drunk to even make a log on Friday. We had a good heart to heart drinking session with Bart. I came clean with my lies, felt good. It aint easy, but damn it is liberating. Now I don't have to pretend to be someone I'm not. Again, win. And who am I? I'm an aspiring engineer, that's how I'll think about myself. Yesterday I spent most of the day in bed watching Peterson's lectures. In one of the lectures he spoke about St George who kills a dragon. He explained the symbolic message: man ventures out into the chaos and confront's it (in the form of dragon). As a result he gets a hand of a maiden. This metaphore reminded me of my own limitation, and when later on my hause mate asked me out to go out to the night club...i said yes. I felt I had no choice, the timing of everything and all. Also I do feel bad about not supporting my housemate who has been struggling for so long to find a girlfriend. ( if you ask me you don't look for a gf in a nightclub but hey...what do I know). Anyway, we ventured out from the safe confines of our own prison in order not to get laid, but to shape our charcters into stronger one's. A hunting test, an expression of primordial need to play the game and to win. (and to become a better player by doing so -- not by winning but by merely playing...you know what I meant!)

## Day 134: May 28th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  No coding done. 

**Thoughts**  Quite a day. So I ventured yesterday into the chaos, to kill the dragon. And to my own surprise ... I did! In other words, I went out to a nightclub and asked a girl out. And she agreed.
Great, right? Well, yes, but...I didn't take my phone with me, so I didn't take her number. She said she didn't have a pen...so I said, I'll be back tomorrow if you are working. She said 'yes, from 11pm'.
Great! So I went over to Przemek's place today for his birthday party. Half the people didn't even turn up, including his own brother who was probably busy boning his housemates, very recent girlfriend. Needles to say, poor shmuck (the recently gilfriendless chap) was present at the party.Didn't matter, we had a jolly good time. 
We even managed to finish the party and get back to city excatly around 11pm! Perfect! So, on our way back home, I walk into yesterdays nightclub, take a quick tour...and fail to find her. One more tour..still nothing. I left.
Didn't say a word to my friend. Once I got back home...I couldn't just let it go. I needed to know! I dressed back up, and went back. This time, I asked the staff about her. Nobody knew her. Right....boy do I felt stupid. 
And that's how victory over the dragon got overshadowed by girly dodge. Ah well, life goes on.

## Day 135: May 29th, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  Nearly done with 10th algo

**Thoughts**  I'm making mistakes at TnE, I'm feeling pressure to finish the journals for accounts team, and more importantly, I haven't forgotten the girl. Did she really lied to me? Why? Did I really misread the situation so badly?
Doesn't matter! (I haven't decided yet if I will try again). What matters is that I code, and I did! So happy goddamn days! Finally.And to my surprise it went really well, almost like I haven't forgotten anything. Pretty cool. It just flowed. 
Bam, like a boss. That's it. That's all that matters in long term. There's plenty more dragons to kill out there, and virgins to be saved. Contempt for failure.

## Day 136: May 30th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  Learning how to use index callback within reduce()

**Thoughts**  At work angry people write angry emails to me. Fair enough. Weird but fine, I'll crush them with nice approach. And I did. 
After work, good tennis session, and a beer. After dinner, I went hunting dragons again. Same dragon. Didn't find it. I'm quite dissapointed again. The longer this goes on the lower the chance anything will come out of this one.
But than again, I can't just give up. I wouldn't feel good about it. I want to be hones and true with myself, and that means doing things that I don't want to do. Simples.
