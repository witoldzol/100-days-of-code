### Day 91: April 3rd, Monday	

**Today's Progress**:  Good progress on 4th advanced macro. Further polished ahk macro and finished whoswho macro (ahk).

**Thoughts** Overall, decent day. It's good to get back to javascript. That moment when I realised how I can iterate through that array while accounting for various different variables...awesome! I would never thoguth of that! Ha.

### Day 92: April 4th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished 4th advanced algorithm!

**Thoughts** Wooooohooo! That was intense! Damn, I'm actually proud of this one. Seriously, when I started out I had no idea how am I going to tackle this one, but as I went further and further, things aligned of their own accord. It's amazing, you write stuff, realize new stuff, write some more, and before you know it, you are done! Damn! Hahaha. I went to my very first coding meetup. There must have been over 60 pepz over there. I didn't speak to anyone, of course, because issues. Nevertheless, I'm happy that I went. I will keep at it, just like I do with the code, until something will give. (but surely, writing code seems easier at times than talking to people you don't know).

### Day 93: April 5th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished 5th advanced algorithm!

**Thoughts** 5th algo was very anti climatic. Super easy. No idea why the difficulity is so wildly different. I understand that for some folks different stuff might be easier / harder. But there is some objective measure i how difficult algo is, and this one, was trivial.
Oh well, no fear, no. 6 is pretty painful. Or trivial again. It's math based, all I have to figure out is the math behind it (assuming there is one...)

### Day 94: April 6th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**:  6th algo is either tough math or recursive function (which I don't get yet)

**Thoughts** I'm tired

### Day 95: April 7th, Friday	

**Today's Progress**:  Stack overflow has priovided answer (actually two ansewers)

**Thoughts** I battle with myself. Should I use stack's answer? Will I learn this way? Maybe I will learn more if I just take it, understand how it works and move on with my life? As opposed to striving to reinvent wheel myself every time. It just doesn't make sense to me to waste time, reading around subject ... if I can just take the answer, analyze it and implement it. I'm going forward, I release fantasy of being an alpha and omega. I will take resources available and use them. Gotta keep moving to stay alive.
