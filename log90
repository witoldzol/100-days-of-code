### Day 91: April 3rd, Monday	

**Today's Progress**:  Good progress on 4th advanced macro. Further polished ahk macro and finished whoswho macro (ahk).

**Thoughts** Overall, decent day. It's good to get back to javascript. That moment when I realised how I can iterate through that array while accounting for various different variables...awesome! I would never thoguth of that! Ha.

### Day 92: April 4th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished 4th advanced algorithm!

**Thoughts** Wooooohooo! That was intense! Damn, I'm actually proud of this one. Seriously, when I started out I had no idea how am I going to tackle this one, but as I went further and further, things aligned of their own accord. It's amazing, you write stuff, realize new stuff, write some more, and before you know it, you are done! Damn! Hahaha. I went to my very first coding meetup. There must have been over 60 pepz over there. I didn't speak to anyone, of course, because issues. Nevertheless, I'm happy that I went. I will keep at it, just like I do with the code, until something will give. (but surely, writing code seems easier at times than talking to people you don't know).

### Day 93: April 5th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished 5th advanced algorithm!

**Thoughts** 5th algo was very anti climatic. Super easy. No idea why the difficulity is so wildly different. I understand that for some folks different stuff might be easier / harder. But there is some objective measure i how difficult algo is, and this one, was trivial.
Oh well, no fear, no. 6 is pretty painful. Or trivial again. It's math based, all I have to figure out is the math behind it (assuming there is one...)

### Day 94: April 6th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**:  6th algo is either tough math or recursive function (which I don't get yet)

**Thoughts** I'm tired

### Day 95: April 7th, Friday	

**Today's Progress**:  Stack overflow has priovided answer (actually two ansewers)

**Thoughts** I battle with myself. Should I use stack's answer? Will I learn this way? Maybe I will learn more if I just take it, understand how it works and move on with my life? As opposed to striving to reinvent wheel myself every time. It just doesn't make sense to me to waste time, reading around subject ... if I can just take the answer, analyze it and implement it. I'm going forward, I release fantasy of being an alpha and omega. I will take resources available and use them. Gotta keep moving to stay alive.

### Day 99: April 11th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Researching recursive functions

**Thoughts** No progress. Dark thoughts. Havent updated log or made commit in 3 days now.

### Day 100: April 12th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Researching recursive functions

**Thoughts** Still no progress. This is big. It's next level. It's like learning nested arrays for the first time again. It hurts. I think I get it now. But I still don't know how to apply / implement. Also, there is a 'way' of designing those functions, so they don't break and eventually do what you want them to do. So, now I gotta learn how to design them without exploding my head. Needless to say, I am having an aweful time. No motivation, no enthusiasm, no energy. Just wanna curl up in a bed and sleep forever. Minute things annoy me, people annoy me. I annoy myself. I know so much, I learned so many techniques...and yet I let my morale go down. I've been working on this coding habit for the past 3 months...and suddenly I feel like it made no difference...no, thats not true. I can't imagine not coding at this point. I might have a few days of slack, but theres no way in hell I'm taking a long term break. I need to remind myself why I do whatever it is that I do. I gotta stay vigilant, and listen to dark whispers in my head, and torpedoe them instantly they appear. I will persevere! Also, today is day 100! (which I realised only today, after 4 days of break - good timing for sure to get back.)

### Day 101: April 13th, Thursday	

**Today's Progress**:  Still researching recursive function. Improved allocation (vba) macro by adding filtering functionality.

**Thoughts** Minor progress with recursion. I got a little bit more practice in. It's starting to make more sense. Now I need to figure out the permutations and their implementation within recursion that includes loop iteration. Mind blown. But I'll get there. I just gotta make the whole abstract thing more tangible, by simply hammering code over and over again, until it becomes something real (if that makes sense).
I've came to a realisation today how deeply paralytic has been my fear of uncertainty over the course of my life. I keep delaying my life, keep postponing until 'this or that'...or until 'im ready' etc. It's been like this since I can remember. These days, over the last few weeks I experenced very vividly stress that came directly from uncertain future. Where will I go, what will I do? But when I thought about it, it made no sense to worry. I've been in new situations many times prior, and I've always managed to, not only survive, but to thrive, at times. Every job I started, I had a blast! I should be looking forward to a change of circumstances, rather than fear them! Regarding my holidays. I really wanted to cancel yesterday, I was feeling down and I just wanted it to be over. But I had a kindling feeling, that I shouldning be making decisions when being emotionally biased. So I didn't. I listened that that faint meek voice at the back of my head. Today, I asked myself...'whats easier, to cancel holiday or to make a plane and execute it as cheap and awesome as possible?'. What woudld Bruce Lee do? He would have gone with the 'difficult' option! I gotta stop running away from problems, stop giving in to phantom fear in my head, because if I continue to do so, it will define my whole life. Baby steps, we start with holiday, we finish with whole new life on a new continent. Fuck it, YOLO!

### Day 102/3: April 14th / 15th, Friday / Saturday	

**Today's Progress**:  No progress on recursion.

**Thoughts** I can't shake a thought that I could be doing so much more. That I waste so much time, that I'm so behind....it makes no god damn sense! Behind what? I wasted years and years just sitting in front of my computer playing games. Now? At least I'm doing something, I'm building towards a rewarding future. (not that it matters, the actual reward is having a goal and working towards it). I still find myself thinking about her. What if's cruising throught my head. I am reminded of her, every time I pass a place we went to together. I never gave her any thought when I was with her. Now that shes gone, she's on my mind. We truly cannot desire what we have. 
I thought that it might be a good idea to surface my fears. At least once a day I think about future, and immediatelly get caught in grips of fear. So maybe I should write them up? Give them a physical form, and myself, a chance to dismantle them. So, ill write every day fear a day.
Today, on my way to the shop, I thought about living in Vietnam, making websites for a living. Immediately, thought came through my mind 'YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO, HOW TO MAKE PROFESSIONAL WEBSITES, YOU WONT MAKE IT....ITS TOO DIFFICULT, THE SECURITY, PROFESSIONAL DESIGN AND UX...YOU DONT KNOW ENOUGH...YOU CAN'T DO IT'.
First of all, I don't have to go anywhere. And when I do, I don't have to make a living. I have lots of savings, enough to last me years without lifting a finger. Second of all, even if I took an assignment to make a website, I can do an easy one. Follow tutorials, stack overflow all the necessary stuff, and ship it. And if it will be crappy, so what? I'll be making it for crappy money anyway. Most of the stuff is modular and have been written anyway. You won't be making anything ambitious for your first projects. And if other people can do it, so can you. Easy peasy. Just time and practice. Just like with nested arrays...I didn't get those at all, my brain hurt justy trying to think about those. And now? It's so obvious, and easy! I get it. I will be ok, wherever I'll go. Worst case scenario I can always get a job as an engish teacher. Best case secnario. I'll live my life.

### Day 104: April 16th, Saturday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished week 3 of Learn how to learn course.

**Thoughts**  Still stuck on that god damn alogrithm. I don't understand how the recursion triggers iteration of the loop inside of it. I guess, it runs it's course, finally returns value?... maybe...and...ahhh.. I have no idea what I'm doing. Good times, learning slowely but surely. I want to get some practice with simple recursions, play around with things, loops ... see how all the elements fit together. Am I obsessing too much about it? Well, I want to learn, not just push the challange for the sake of unlocking it. It's an important bit I fell so I will be patient with myself. Also, I want to implement 'to do' list (again). Not sure what is the best wayt to go about it. Should I write it down, or use computer. Hmm. It's easier to type it out, but than again, its easier to look it up on the paper....paper it is!

### Day 105: April 17th, Sunday	

**Today's Progress**:  Day off from coding. 

**Thoughts**  I collected my motorbike from the mechanic today, played tennis, made dinner and laundry. All in all, today was a good day. I didn't do any coding, but I've decided not to feel bad about it. I will put in some work tomorrow, at work. Plan is to meet daily quota before lunch, and focus on my stuff for the rest of the day. I've seen a presentation given by some young guy. He talked about creating things, and how to execute them. He brought to attention how amazing times we live in are. We have so many options, public and instantly accessible knowledge about anything we desire to learn. Truly 'magical' times. Yes. I keep thinking about Bou, that guy who has a family, two small kids, full time job, how did 3 year degree in half a year, and than a bunch of other courses in record time. And now he is making a ton of guide videos on javascript. How does he do it? This confidence, and power of commitment eludes me. I wish I could be like that...and I know I can. I also know that I create in my mind an invisible wall, and keep telling myslf that I can't cross it, that certain things are impossible for me. I cognitively know that I can, yet I am aware of my own, self imposed, limitations. How do I dimantle them? Confidence!
I remember watching a guy give a speech on how to pick up women. All I remember from this, is that lack of confidence comes from lack of knowledge. Its so obvious, yet not intuitive (to me at least). Long story short, if you know what you doing, you will be confident. Same with coding, working as a freelancer etc. All I gotta do is to learn what to do, and I will be able to push my limits. But wait...isn't overcoming limitation all about moving outside of comfort zone, and doing things without actually knowing / havign confidence? So to speak, taking a dive into a deep water? Well, maybe. But I don't care, there is only one person to judge me, and that is myself. I won't do anything without confidence, hence all I care about is gettin some, and not adhering to some imaginary 'you should be this or that'. Good enough for me.

### Day 106: April 18th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**:  No progress. Again. 

**Thoughts**  I'm dejected at this stage. I'm looking at the same solution for two weeks now and still don't understand nor can replicate it. Is it too much? Am I missing some fundamental understanding underlying this algo? You know what? I don't care, I will keep going back until it will make fucking sense. I don't care if this is efficient, I don't care if I could work harder or whatever the fuck I keep telling myslef. I will just sit in front of my computer every fucking day and stare at the solution until it makes sense.

### Day 109: April 21th, Friday	

**Today's Progress**:  More progress on vba macro

**Thoughts**  I'm floating. Three months of coding every day, and it all fizzled out. So much for a habit.
