### Day 91: April 3rd, Monday	

**Today's Progress**:  Good progress on 4th advanced macro. Further polished ahk macro and finished whoswho macro (ahk).

**Thoughts** Overall, decent day. It's good to get back to javascript. That moment when I realised how I can iterate through that array while accounting for various different variables...awesome! I would never thoguth of that! Ha.

### Day 92: April 4th, Tuesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished 4th advanced algorithm!

**Thoughts** Wooooohooo! That was intense! Damn, I'm actually proud of this one. Seriously, when I started out I had no idea how am I going to tackle this one, but as I went further and further, things aligned of their own accord. It's amazing, you write stuff, realize new stuff, write some more, and before you know it, you are done! Damn! Hahaha. I went to my very first coding meetup. There must have been over 60 pepz over there. I didn't speak to anyone, of course, because issues. Nevertheless, I'm happy that I went. I will keep at it, just like I do with the code, until something will give. (but surely, writing code seems easier at times than talking to people you don't know).

### Day 93: April 5th, Wednesday	

**Today's Progress**:  Finished 5th advanced algorithm!

**Thoughts** 5th algo was very anti climatic. Super easy. No idea why the difficulity is so wildly different. I understand that for some folks different stuff might be easier / harder. But there is some objective measure i how difficult algo is, and this one, was trivial.
Oh well, no fear, no. 6 is pretty painful. Or trivial again. It's math based, all I have to figure out is the math behind it (assuming there is one...)
